    "It turns out that one good sleep is all I really need. I get out of bed without a fuss the following morning to eagerly accompany Sibyl to breakfast."
    "She and Tanya follow their usual routine of exchanging the strawberry while I revel in my extra high stack of French tost with extra maple syrup."
    C "(If I stay at this school any longer they're going to have to roll me out.)"
    "I resolve to go with a lighter calorie yogurt parfait another day, but for today am satisfied that I need the calories after crying half my water weight out of my eyes the night before."
    T "...And then she told me that I had {b}\"perfectly perfunctory perfumery\"{/b}!"
    S "I think... I think that was an insult."
    T "When it comes to Sierra, who even knows?"
    "A cube of cantaloupe speared on a fork slips through Sibyl's lips while she listens to her friend prattle on."
    "It occurs to me suddenly and randomly that I could do the same with the strawberry atop my yogurt parfait, just like Tanya does every day."
    C "(I like strawberries, but maybe Sibyl likes them way more than me?)"
    "Mundane thoughts like these are new as of yesterday. After calming down considerably from the emotional highs of the care package, I finally called my parents."
    "I initially felt a considerable amount of anxiety tightening my chest, almost like Abraxas was sitting on my chest as I dialed the numbers, but it did not last."
    "When the phone connected and I heard my parents' voices again, the rush of furious bile that I had feared never materialized."
    "We spoke about a lot of things. Most of all they wanted to hear about my new school and friends, which made me realize at the time I had embarrassingly little to relate."
    "I just couldn't bear to tell my parents that I made no friends whatsoever after spending my whole time here being a massive nuisance to everyone, so I told them all I knew about my roommate."
    C "(If there's anyone who might fit the description of being my friend, it's the girl who wouldn't turn on me even after being so rude to her.)"
    "Sibyl hasn't treated me any differently since my sudden change of heart, but I'd still like to apologize for all the awfulness I put her through."
    C "(How do I make \"sorry for being a bitch\" sound better?)"
    "Most important of all, I promised my parents that I'd have more to tell them about next time they called, so I have good reason to be watching Sibyl so closely today."
    S "Clover?"
    C "A-Hunh?"
    "Lost in my thoughts while observing fruit disappear between her lips, I don't even realize when Sibyl addresses me directly. Tanya, it seems, has gone off somewhere, leaving the two of us alone."
    S "Are you feeling well? You've been kinda... lost in space, all morning."
    C "I'm... I'm good."
    "The anger and frustration I'd been suffering from may be mostly gone, but something is still off. Shaking off the daze from the depth of my thoughts, an awkwardness seeps in to replace it."
    "Sibyl must be feeling it too. I can tell she's restraining herself around me despite being such a chatterbox with Tanya. It's actually making me feel a little jealous for some reason."
    C "Sibyl, umm... what did you do?"
    S "Excuse me...?"
    "As usual, my intense rate of mental processing is making my thoughts churn through faster than my mouth can voice them."
    C "(Come on, Clover, get your brain into gear! You're only at breakfast and there's a full day of classes to suffer through yet.)"
    C "Before I came here. When you weren't with Tanya, how did you spend your time outside of class?"
    S "You want to know about me?"
    "She says the words like a question, but by the looks of her face it's more of a surprised yet joyful statement."
    "I can already feel a bashful flush spread across my face, but bravely push through it for the sake of learning more about the one and only person I might potentially call a friend."
    S "I'm so glad you're feeling better, Clover. You {b}are{/b} feeling better, right?"
    C "I think so? Let's say \"yes\" for now."
    "The anger may have been diminished into mere resentment, but there's still a confusing vortex of unknown emotions swirling inside my heart which I have yet to settle into the correct places."
    C "But anyway, I'd like to know more. About you. Which is why I asked."
    S "I see! Well, whenever I was alone I would most often either work on a project in the art room or find a new book in the library."
    S "Sometimes I would take a stroll outside or watch the sports teams practice. There's only so much to do on campus, but I've never been bored."
    "I know that Sibyl is part of the art club of course, and it's hard to miss the canvases and art supplies scattered about her side of the room, but I do recall her reading something to now that I think about it."
    C "(I've been buried too deep into my own head to really, actually {b}look{/b} at what Sibyl has been doing.)"
    S "Have you visited the library yet, Clover? It's {b}wondrous{/b}. The light streams through the windows in such a picturesque way and the smell is just perfect."
    C "(The smell? Of the library? Is that a normal thing to appreciate?)"
    C "Just once but I was kind of out of it at the time."
    S "Then you must come with me tomorrow evening. I've been meaning to pick up a new novel anyway so it is as good a time as ever."
    C "I didn't know you were so into reading, Sibyl."
    S "There are a lot of things you don't know about me Clover!"
    "I distinctly feel as though we've had this conversation before, but this time Sibyl is much more happy to be saying the same thing."
    # tanya shows up
    T "They were out of blueberry so I got us both lemon poppy seed. Is that alright, Sibyl?"
    "Tanya returns out of nowhere to drop one of the two tasty-looking muffins she carries in front of Sibyl."
    S "Lemon poppy seed is just as delicious. Thank you."
    C "(So, wait, Tanya refuses to eat strawberries for having seeds on the outside, but is okay with muffins freckled with seeds?)"
    "I can tell by the disappointment in her voice and suspicious glance at her own muffin that Tanya isn't thrilled about all the seeds adorning the pastry, just as I anticipated."
    S "Tanya, I am going to show Clover the library tomorrow. Would you like to come with us?"
    "Sibyl's best friend unexpectedly turns down the offer, much to my surprise. I smile at the thought of having Sibyl all to myself — until Tanya gives me a dirty look the second Sibyl turns away."
    C "(I'm not trying to {b}steal{/b} your best friend.)"
    "I say the words in my head but they obviously don't transmit into Tanya's mind through the open air."
    S "Oh, that's right, you're always busy Saturday evening. Maybe another time then; I'd like to find an activity the three of us can do together."
    "I don't even know whether she's intentionally guilt tripping us or not, but both Tanya and I simultaneously fail to meet Sibyl's gaze. Tanya carefully picks at the poppy seeds on the outside of her muffin, and I just stare down at my empty plate."

    mw "That's what I like to hear! You've been a great gym partner, Sibyl, but now it's your turn to teach Clover the ropes. Are you up for it?"
    S "Yes, ma'am!"
    "A certain thought sticks with me while watching Sibyl and Miss Woolsey go back and forth in such a warm and friendly manner. I cannot help but voice it when our teacher finally leaves."
    C "You and Miss Woolsey are good friends, huh?"
    "This probably should have been clear to me by how they acted around one another the first day when we missed dinner, but I was way too far into my own head at the time to realize it."
    S "I have enjoyed the honor of having Miss Woolsey for my gym partner these past few months, owing of course to having no Vertu partner of my own."
    C "I'm so sorry."
    "Truly full of pity, I shudder to think about it. Being forced to pair with the gym teacher {b}every class{/b} is all but tantamount so social suicide by standard high school convention."

    C "Maybe it's the dog lover in me speaking, but she sounds, umm... quirky."
    S "We all have our quirks, Clover. Is that any different from knowing all about \"Abraxas, the three-hundred-sixty-fifth prince of the basilica gnocchi—\""
    C "Ahh, no, stop!"
    "I wave my arms about frantically until Sibyl hushes up about all the cringe-worthy stuff I was interested in during middle school, and don't even mention how {b}wrong{/b} she is getting it all."
    "My cheeks burn red but no one around seems to have noticed a thing. Sibyl merely smiles back as she offers out a lacrosse stick for me to grab."
    S "Have you played lacrosse before, Clover?"
    C "Nope, but we did have a girls' team at my old school."
    "I begin with every intention of passing the ball from the netting at the end of my stick by planting my feet and whipping the head forward, but nothing happens."
    "The ball remains stubbornly in my net despite how much I shake it out in frustration, and ultimately end up smacking myself over the head with my own stick while the ball dribbles out at my feet."
    "Sibyl barely holds back a giggle at my expense."
    C "Ow. Okay, yeah, I have no idea what I'm doing. Help me, Sibyl."
    "Sibyl instructs me on where to properly place my hands upon the stick, or {i}crosse{/i}, how to take the correct stance, and finally the correct motion to make the pass successfully."
    "In no time at all we're passing the ball back and forth like I didn't just pick up a crosse for the first time in my entire life."
    S "You're a natural, Clover!"
    C "Thanks!"
    "It feels so strangely good to move in time with Sibyl as we volley to each other that I cannot help but allow my lips to spread into a broad grin."
    C "(I'm having... fun!)"
    "As it turns out, it's a lot easier to have fun when you're not trying desperately to {b}not{/b} have fun."
    S "You should think about joining the academy's team! They're always looking for more girls."
    C "The lacrosse team? Are you on the team?"
    "I know it's a silly question the moment I speak it aloud as I am well aware that Sibyl is part of the art club. The playful mood of the moment I'm sharing with Sibyl must have made me as dumb as the smile upon my face."
    S "I am not on the team, no, but it is possible to split time with the art club on days when the lacrosse team has no training."
    "I cannot deny that the stick feels pretty good in my hands but I don't know how I'd compare against actual players, and without the major confidence boost from Sibyl's encouragement for that matter."
    C "I'll think about it."
    "As much fun as I may be having, the exertion finally catches up to both of us and we have to pause to catch our breaths. A small commotion catches my eye across the gym."
    "It's Tanya, with her hair all disarrayed and face flushed like that time I made her mad in the aquarium, but this time I'm not the one facing her fury."
    T "Hraaah!"
    "Her stick swishes through the air in a mighty arc, propelling the ball forcefully toward another girl across from her who dodges it with a sharp squeal."
    C "Is that...?"
    S "Sierra? Mmhm."
    "I've noticed her in classes but never really {b}seen{/b} her, so to speak. Now that I do, she fits just about every expectation I might have given the way Tanya talks about her."
    C "She's gorgeous."
    "It's not just a natural beauty, but also the manner in which she holds herself, keeping her chin upright no matter how fast the balls come whizzing at her head."
    C "(She's clearly one of those rich girl types that seem to be strangely numerous here. Must be a private school thing.)"
    S "It's really too bad about her personality though."
    "As pretty as Sierra might be, she doesn't capture my attention nearly as much as Sibyl, to whom I find my gaze drawn back toward as naturally as birds fly through the air."
    S "Clover?"
    C "Hmm?"
    S "Are you ready to begin again?"
    "Sibyl has already turned back to face me instead of Sierra before I know it. I'm the only one who is left with her head in the clouds."

    S "Was it a good dream?"
    "Sibyl sits across from me at the lunch table with not a single plate before her and all of her attention instead solely on me. She actually seems interested in my dream, for real."
    C "Yeah. I was playing lacrosse. It was a warm Spring day out and I was running down toward the goal to pass the strawberry to you, but then all these dark shadows got in the way."

    C "(Oh right, I was going to the library with Sibyl today.)"
    C "Maybe I will. After all, who else should I trust to interpret my dreams than a \"Sibyl\"?"
    "The namesake girl smiles at me so brightly from across the table that I nearly choke on a ham cube from the savory side of my crepe platter."
    S "Are you alright, Clover?"

    "I obviously noticed she wasn't hanging around Sibyl as she usually does every day, but hadn't brought it up at all as if speaking her name aloud would be enough to summon her presence."

    S "Tanya always disappears on Saturday afternoon."
    C "Why?"

    "The question tumbles out heedlessly, forcing me to quickly add on a hasty \"You don't have to answer!\" as an afterthought."
    "A group of girls carrying boxes turns around the corner of the hallway before us. Sibyl grabs my hand to pull me out of the way as they pass."
    S "Of course I want to tell you about myself, Clover. I've only been waiting for you to want to know about me."
    "As we stand there in the hallway, her hand around mind, I recall to mind the image of Anne and Diana standing with hands clasped, gazing at each other bashfully amongst the tiger lilies."
    "The moment ends just as quickly as it comes. Once the girls pass us, Sibyl releases my hand but remains where she is."
    S "Clover, I'm an orphan, just like Anne."
    C "You are!?"
    S "I am indeed. Did you expect me to have \"no family\" branded on my forehead?"
    "Sibyl makes a joke which to me seems a little indelicate, but maybe after living your whole life that way it doesn't quite hurt you so much."
    C "Ah, no, sorry, I'm just being stupid I guess."
    C "(This whole time I've been making such a big stink about my parents' divorce, and Sibyl doesn't even have any to begin with!)"
    "I can barely stand to look at Sibyl with how ridiculous and in all likelihood {b}rude{/b} I have been this whole time that I've known her, but she continues on unoffended and instead rather cheerfully."
    S "I was always at the library as a girl. I liked my foster family but everyone in a crowded foster home needs some alone time."
    S "When I discovered Anne, I empathized with her right away. So taken by her was I that I even took on her personality as well, letting my imagination run wild and blabbering non-stop."
    "A rare bashful fluster comes across Sibyl's cheeks as she speaks, which suits her graceful features wonderfully so I think."
    S "I probably made life hell for all my foster brothers and sisters, to be honest. Even know I'm still dreaming about my own Green Gables..."
    "What was a rather cheerful recollection suddenly turns wistful by the end, but the emotion is mercifully fleeting upon her face."
    "Sibyl's attention turns presently back to me from out of her own memories, making me flinch in painless agony to see her cheerful countenance after having said something so sad."
    C "(No matter how difficult things may have gotten at home, my parents are still alive and care for me deeply.)"
    "It's strange how foolish the me of a week past was to deny the warmth I feel in my chest when I think of my family now."
    C "(Sibyl has been deprived of that warmth.)"
    S "You might say that every day since winning my scholarship has been just another chapter in {i}Sibyl of Prudence Prep{/i}."
    C "Wow, Sibyl, I had no idea..."
    S "How could you, with your own problems at the forefront of your mind?"
    "Sibyl strikes right out for my weak spot, landing a fatal blow. She's not really intending to hurt me with the accusatory reply, but there's no doubt she means to say that I've been a pain these past days."
    C "Sibyl, I'm so sorry for being such a terrible person, I—"
    "Sibyl reaches for my hand again, instantly shutting me up and making my heart feel like it's going to burst straight out of my chest like the alien from that movie."
    S "Stop, Clover, it's in the past now."
    "I stop, just as ordered, and swallow the lump in my throat while I do. Sibyl smiles sweetly and resumes us walking again after the moment passes."
    C "So if you're Anne, who is Diana?"
    "For some reason, the question burns inside me such that I cannot stop it from jumping out of my mouth."
    S "I had hoped that she would be my Vertu partner."
    "Warmth enkindles inside my chest from some source unknown, only to be harshly doused by her next reply."
    S "...Until she never came. Then I met Tanya."
    "I know Tanya probably hates me, and I am not by any means particularly fond of her either, but hearing Sibyl name Tanya as her \"bosom friend\" really sinks me into the depths emotionally."
    C "So it's Tanya?"
    S "Oh, but you're here now too, and I don't think Anne would ever say you can't have {b}two{/b} \"bosom friends\", would she?"
    "It's a complicated feeling, that which settles into the pit of my stomach, caught somewhere between hope and despair."
    "What disturbs me most of all is that someone I've only known for a week should be doing these things to my heart at all."

    C "Make... what?"
    S "Chocolates! Don't you remember what our homeroom teacher told us last week?"
    "I clearly don't, and I might have what passes for an excuse in that I might have been skipping class that day."

    "Whatever that may mean is yet illusive to me, but it makes the twins and Miss Izzie all smirk to themselves while Tanya merely rolls her eyes."
    T "Yes, a frottage collage. I plan to use the same sheet for all textures and let them overlap some, thus creating a unique blend where they merge."
    S "That sounds lovely, Tanya."
    "Tanya follows Miss Izzie to the storage room where the art supplies are kept, and the twins follow them for some reason which I am definitely not complaining about."
    S "It's a method of reproducing a surface texture by placing a material like paper against a subject and rubbing it with something like charcoal or a pencil."
    C "Huh?"

    C "(What is {b}that{/b} supposed to mean?)"
    C "Where do those two get off acting like that anyway? Just because they're in charge of the student council?"
    S "My impression is that they act that way simply because it amuses them."
    "While I try to reconcile the words and action of the two mystifying twins, Sibyl begins browsing through the completed artworks stacked into crates."
    S "If you can manage to look past their eccentricities, Vittoria and Vincenza do take their roles with the student council seriously. Tanya is friendly with them too so I try not to look upon them so harshly."
    "After a flurry of her fingers flipping through all of the collected artworks, Sibyl stops and slides one of the canvases out of the crate to hold up for me to view, beaming all the way."
    S "Aha! Here it is! What do you think?"
    "It's pretty clearly a painting of the school grounds in Autumn. I recognize it even without all the snow on the ground."
    "Each stroke of the brush is clearly visible with thick globs of paint smeared across the canvas, giving it a distinctly smudged look I've seen from other famous paintings."
    C "This is the main pathway up to the academy, right? It looks nice."
    "I've never been much of an art critic, but it does look neat and I have a sneaking suspicion that Sibyl painted this one herself with how proudly she's smiling at me."
    S "Thank you! I'm doing a whole study of this particular scene, one for each season."
    S "This is Autumn, obviously. See how I used a heavy impressionist stroke with the oil paints to portray the colors in the trees?"
    "Sibyl cranes her head around the canvas and reaches a finger to point out a tree, where she uses only a few blotches of different shades of orange, yellow, and red together to portray a multitude of hues."
    "I don't really get it, but I can feel the joyous energy radiating off Sibyl as she shows me her work, and that's enough for me."
    S "I did the Summer in acrylics and am currently working through Winter with watercolors. It's so hard to get {b}just{/b} the right hues of off-white for the snow, but I like the challenge."
    S "I'm thinking about doing Spring with spray paint!"
    C "Spray paint? Like on a wall?"
    S "No, silly, on canvas, with stencils!"
    S "What you do is analyze the subject and break it down into a ton of little simple shapes, cut out those shapes from paper, then spray over it to leave only that shape on the canvas."
    S "It requires a very good eye for composition since everything has to be broken into those smaller shapes rather than created a whole, but I think I can do it."
    C "If there's anyone who can do it, it would be you, Sibyl. My brain is already melting just trying to follow what you're saying."
    S "It's easy enough to get started, and fun too! You should give it a try in art class, Clover."
    C "Maybe..."
    "Spray paint is one thing I actually do have experience with from growing up a a creepy little goth kid."
    "When I think back to that phase where I would spray paint dark and edgy \"arcane\" symbols on trees at the park, I can only cringe with utmost shame."
    C "(And then when I heard the police started investigating them, I ditched the spray paint in the trash and cowered in my bed.)"
    "Desperately do I need to stop returning to the dark, dark days of middle school, so I try to turn conversation back around to Sibyl instead."
    C "How did you get started with art, Sibyl?"
    "While I was off in my own world, Sibyl seems to have returned her canvas to the stack and begun searching through the rest. When I ask her the question, she pauses to answer."
    S "Oh, well, I told you about how I went through that embarrassing phase of acting like Anne Shirley, right?"
    "A soft flush comes to Sibyl's cheeks, which I find incredibly adorable to witness."
    C "(I'm so glad I'm not the only one here embarrassed by her past, but mine is definitely {b}way{/b} more mortifying.)"
    S "My foster parents sat me down with a bunch of art supplies as a way to channel my outpouring of imagination into a more constructive outlet."
    S "And, well, I just think everyone was tired of hearing me chattering about nonsense too."
    C "That's... kind of cute."
    S "You think so?"

    C "How long do I have to keep stirring it?"

    "Sibyl pauses suddenly, looking straight into my eyes with a look of utmost seriousness. I flinch against her touch when he steps in closer and raises her hand up to my face, unsure of what she's doing, but only feel a small poke against my right cheek."

    C "I think I can do it, probably."
    "I reach for the handle to pick up the bowl but Sibyl quickly stops me right there."
    S "How about I do this first one, and you do the next?"
    "Contrary to what I was thinking initially, the right way to fill the little half sphere mold that Sibyl picks out is {b}not{/b} to pick up the bowl and pour molten chocolate over the edge."
    "Instead, Sibyl gets a roll of parchment paper, cuts off a piece, and forms it into a cone she calls a \"piping bag\". She cuts the tip off then scoops some of the chocolate in the big end."
    C "Wow, you're like an expert at this."
    "Neatly she controls the flow out of the narrow tip, expertly filling in the little cavities of the mold without any spillage."

    S "That's so thoughtful!"
    "Only a few of the textures on the paper do I recognize, those including the numbers to the room we share and the embossed title of the book I returned just recently."
    "As the two explore the different textures on the box, I quickly learn a few things I have yet to discover about Sibyl, such as that she has a favorite tree for reading under in warm weather."
    S "Oh yeah, I'm a real nature girl when weather permits!"
    "Sibyl begins to explain this surprising new fact to me, but Tanya cuts right back in again before she is able to divulge the secret to finding the best earthworms."
    T "Just don't go wandering around too far when I'm not around. Remember what happened when we did orienteering in gym class?"
    "Sierra was, according to Tanya, faking illness that gym class so she paired up with Sibyl for orienteering. Just as they were setting out, I am informed, Sibyl started chasing a butterfly until they became completely lost in the forest surrounding the campus."
    S "In my defense, it was a {b}really{/b} pretty butterfly."
    C "(It's a funny story, probably, if you were there.)"
    "The way Sibyl and Tanya get to laugh together and bond over their shared experiences kind of hurts to watch."
    "It really drives through me the stake of truth that I'm still very much an outsider to this school, and also to Sibyl's life."
    "Much like a vampire from my current novella, it makes me feel like I'll just crumble to dust."

    "My brow furrows into deep ridges, my brain spinning in overdrive thinking back to the day I arrived. T he twins started feeling me up when I was already in a funk about being sent to the academy."
    C "(I thought it was white hot anger, but maybe that wasn't all I felt that day.)"
    "Then they left me to cool in the cold night air and I went to my room where I met Sibyl; where I first saw her fluffy, sweet-smelling hair and angelic sleeping face, and learned of her goofy but caring personality."
    C "(I had my sexual awakening and fell in love for the first time in the very same evening.)"
    "\"Love\". The words makes my tongue tingle even though I said it only in my mind, completely inaudibly."
    "The thoughts which have been thrashing about in my mind come piling back in with force, only to be quelled when Vincenza calls out to me and draws me back down from the stratosphere."
    O "Earth to Clover."
    H "Shall I continue?"
    C "Huh?"
    "Vittoria wiggles her fingers out before her as suggestively as she wiggles her eyebrows toward me."
    C "{b}N-No!{/b}"
    H "Make up your mind! Are you gay or not!?"
    C "Yes, I am, but not for {b}you{/b}!"
    H "But you said—!?"
    C "I'm just... a late bloomer, okay?"
    "I feel so stupid for having just assumed I was straight this entire time. In all the times I've tried to imagine myself with a boy, I've never felt the way I do about Sibyl right now."
    C "I don't feel anything for either of you, but you did help me realize that I probably love her."
    O "Who is... \"her\"?"
    "I quickly stuff a hand over my mouth, but it's far too late. Vincenza in particular seems to be interested in my story now and I have a feeling she's not going to let me wiggle out of this one easily."
    C "None of your business, that's who. I misspoke."
    "Turning to make eye contact with Vittoria, Vincenza does that thing where she and her sister communicate faster than the speed of light simply by proximity alone."
    O "Could it be?"
    H "Our little Tanya?"
    O "It's a good match."
    "A shiver of disgust trembles across my body as the image of Tanya's face explodes unbidden into my mind."
    C "{b}Blegh.{/b} I'd rather die."
    H "Heavens! What a dreadful thing to say about your dearest companion!"
    "While Vittoria continues to tease and flirt with me in the most infuriating fashion, I just tell them what they want to hear in hopes of ending this sooner."
    C "(It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out when I barely talk to anyone but Sibyl.)"
    C "Tanya is {b}not{/b} my \"dearest companion\". She's barely even a friend, if that. The only person I care about is Sibyl."
    C "I like her. I... think I might {b}love{/b} her."
    "The words spill from my lips far easier than I expect them too. For as much as my brain has been turning it over in my head, it sounds perfectly natural and correct once I say it aloud."
    O "So the kind-hearted Sibyl who stood by you in your darkest days is the lucky girl to have tied your heartstrings into knots."
    H "How awful to be left helplessly pining for your doomed love, cursed to be with her every waking day but never feel the warmth of her flesh."
    C "Don't just decide my love is doomed for yourself!"
    H "Clover, darling..."
    O "There will be others."
    "Vittoria droops her head to one side to accentuate the look of absolute pity she offers me while Vincenza at least tries to seriously console me from whatever they're talking about."
    C "I don't need any \"others\", least of all {b}you two{/b}, so stop trying."
    "The twins once again turn to speak to each other as if I am not present at all and being pressured back against a wall between the two of them."
    H "She doesn't know, Vincenza. Do we crush her heart now or let it wither in time?"
    O "It would be a mercy, Vittoria, to let her down easily while we still can."
    C "Oh, just spit it out already."
    "The twins strike soft-hearted poses matching their unique personas, Vittoria with her a hand gently resting upon her cheek and Vincenza with her arms crossed at her chest."
    O "Clover, your tale ends only in tragedy."
    H "You're not the first to try to pluck that stubborn flower."
    C "What do you mean?"
    "The words tumble out of my lips in a tone tinged with desperation. I wouldn't normally put any stock in what the twins say whatsoever, but something inside of me knows they are not joking this time."
    O "Sibyl is {b}straight{/b}, Clover."
    "The simple sentence drives a stake right through my heart."
    C "No..."
    "I've heard those words before, but only now that I've come to terms with my own feelings do I fully realize what they mean to me."
    H "Frighteningly so, I'm afraid. She rejected even Vincenza and I without the slightest hesitation."
    "Vittoria's casual tone does nothing to soothe the flash of hot anger that flares up inside me at the thought that these two perverts had tried to put their moves on {b}my{/b} Sibyl."
    "The growing angst inside of me smothers the ember of anger before it can light any larger fires in my heart."
    O "But maybe if you had a pair of guardian angels sitting on your shoulders..."
    "Vincenza's tentative musing draws me out of my growing stupor to find the twins sharing another inaudible conversation with a meeting of their eyes."
    "A broad smile stretches maliciously across Vittoria's face as the pair closes in around me, speaking low and quietly almost in my ears."
    H "...Two girls uniquely positioned to make girls' loves like yours flourish..."
    C "No!"
    "I push out between Vittoria and Vincenza before me, squeaking through the gap I open between them."
    C "No, no, no, no. You're not angels, you're {b}devils{/b}."
    C "I don't need your help. I don't {b}want{/b} your help. I'm going to get through to Sibyl no matter what you say, or what Tanya says!"
