    C "(I was way too distracted for my first few weeks of lacrosse practice, but today I will kick it into high gear!)"
    "Saturday morning practice starts with a paired warm up passing exercise. Overhand, underhand, even sidearm — I do them all, and well enough that Miss Woolsey is impressed by my speed in picking up the technique too."
    "After warmup we split to play shifts of {i}sixes{/i}, a type of lacrosse where two teams of five \"runners\", who play both offense and defense, and a goaltender face off in a fast-paced, non-stop lacrosse match."
    "While I wait my turn to run to play as one of the runners, I focus my energies on practicing my {i}cradle{/i} technique."
    "By moving the crosse in a semi-circular motion to produce centrifugal forces, the ball can be kept securely in the crosse even at an elevated position."
    "It's an essential skill which has been something of an issue for me in past practices, so starting today it's one of my highest priorities to get right."
    mw "Priya, swap out; Clover, you're in!"
    "Miss Woolsey calls out my name as part of substitutions for the next sixes match, giving me the perfect opportunity to put my new and improved skills to the test."
    C "Yes, ma'am!"
    "Full of confidence, I place myself forward to take the draw and hopefully win the ball to start my team off with possession."
    "As I line up with my stick crossed at waist level before me, I narrow my focus on what actions I'm going to take to sweep the ball to my teammates."
    "Nothing else matters in all the world but winning that little yellow rubber ball... until my opponent arrives to place her stick right up against mine."

    "My trash talking doesn't hold a candle and I know it, but try again I must lest Tanya take away this exchange as a victory of her own."

    T "You've already lost, Clover."
    C "Huh—?"
    "When the ball is released in front of us, I'm way late to the snap given my preoccupations with Tanya taking precedence over watching Miss Woolsey. Tanya wins the draw and lobs the ball her side with barely any challenge."
    C "(I played right into her head games, that bitch!)"

    mw "Great check, Clover!"

    "I trot right on over to her to gloat in the few second it takes for the goaltender to fetch the ball and throw it back into play, but when I face her she isn't visibly upset in the slightest."
    T "Nice take away, Clover."
    C "Uhh... thanks."
    "The interaction leaves me deflated and confused as play resumes once again. I try not to let her behavior get to me any further and keep the obtrusive thoughts at bay, but they remain there in the back of my mind nevertheless."

    "Once the half time break arrives, I march right over to Tanya with an aim to get her to tell me exactly what she's up to this time."
    C "What's your problem, Tanya?"
    "I catch Tanya taking a big gulp out of her water bottle but I know she hears me because I can see her eyes glance my way. Still, she takes her time hydrating before acknowledging me further."
    T "If you're asking why I scored two goals while you scored none, that's just because I'm a better athlete than you."
    "If I weren't also tired from all the activity on the field of play and at the moment using my stick as a crutch to rest my weary legs, I might have just smacked her over the head with it then and there."
    C "That's {b}exactly{/b} the kind of crap I'm talking about."
    "As nonchalant as ever, Tanya swipes the sweat off her brow with her body turned slightly away from me before responding once again."
    T "Better that you learn not to let your opponent take you off your game now rather than when we're playing against one of our rivals. The girls at Snipatuit High are particularly nasty."
    T "We're both Wild Roses, Clover. It's in the best interest of the team that you are playing at your best before Spring season starts."
    "I cannot deny that her little trick {b}did{/b} teach me a lesson about maintaining focus, and my vexation at her behavior {b}did{/b} make me play better as a result."
    C "So what you're saying is that all of that talk was just to make me perform better in the game?"
    T "That, and I'm still pissed about what you did to Sibyl."
    C "(There we go. {b}That's{/b} what I expected to hear.)"
    "I'm not surprised, exactly, and nor do I blame her. Privately, without ever speaking the ghastly words aloud, do I admit that Tanya was right when she warned me in advance to give up on Sibyl."
    C "(But Hell itself will freeze over before I give her the opportunity to say \"told you so\".)"
    T "Oh, and before I forget, \"I told you so\" about Sibyl. There's absolutely no way any girl would change her preferences, least of all {b}you{/b}."
    C "O-Oh— Oh, {b}yeah{/b}!?"
    "I thought I was being remarkably conciliatory in not blowing up at Tanya after everything she's done today, but this I will not endure any longer."
    C "Well, I have some news for you, Tanya. Sibyl and I {b}kissed{/b}."
    "I wasn't planning to ever tell Tanya for fear that she really does murder me one day, but she's practically asking me to throw this into her face right now, so I do."
    T "You're going to have to try better than that, Clover. "
    "The revelation I spit out at Tanya fails to land entirely. She's more interested in Miss Woolsey instructing one of our goaltenders on the other side of the gymnasium."
    C "I'm not lying. I asked her for it — for one kiss in exchange for me giving up forever — and she {b}agreed{/b}."
    C "We kissed, it was {b}amazing{/b}, and you'll never {b}ever{/b} get to know the feeling of Sibyl's lips like I do."
    "It's with a great deal of satisfaction that I spot Tanya's indifferent facade start to crumble in the face of my taunts. Her gaze edges back my way despite her attempt to appear unaffected."
    T "Sibyl is straight, a fact I know painfully well, and she doesn't like you that way. She'd never let you kiss her."
    C "You're right, I didn't kiss her. {b}She{/b} kissed {b}me{/b}."
    "I feel so delightfully devilish rubbing my kiss into Tanya's face after she's been acting so high and mighty all of practice."
    "Maybe it's the unshakeable smirk plastered on my face, or perhaps it's that Tanya knows Sibyl is too kind for her own good, but something really shakes her confidence to my benefit."
    T "Y-You're lying! She'd {b}never{/b}!"
    C "Well she {b}did{/b} so... yeah."
    "Now it's my turn to turn away slightly like I don't even care about Tanya silently fretting over my shocking admission. I still keep her in my peripheral vision just in case."
    mw "Two minutes to draw, everyone!"
    "Miss Woolsey ensures I have the last word in this particular confrontation by announcing the imminent start of the second half of the match."
    "The second half of our match is exactly the opposite of the first. While I am on top of my game, there's no doubt that Tanya is slipping."
    "When Tanya manages to snag the ball in their end of the field of play, she charges right up the field toward our goal on the attack. I fall back to help defend the goal but find her attention not on it at all, and rather locked onto me."
    T "Hrahh!"
    "All of Tanya's strength goes into the throw, launching the ball probably close to the speed of sound right between my eyes."
    C "(Oh crap)!"
    "I manage to evade the heavy lob entirely on survival instinct alone. I even manage to bounce it off my stick into the pocket of my nearby teammate, though that is entirely by lucky happenstance."
    mw "Nice block, Clover!"
    C "(It's nice and all to hear Miss Woolsey compliment my playing, but it how did she miss Tanya whipping that ball at my face?)"
    "Logically, I know that she didn't have the benefit of having locked eyes with Tanya's evil stare as she slapped the ball my way, but it still would have been nice to be acknowledged as the victim here."

    "The worst part about the whole magazine is the way it seems to be rubbing in my face how single I am right now after my first love blew up like a thermonuclear explosion in my face."
    "Almost on instinct, I look up toward the girl who occupies the darkest corner of my mind at the moment, and finally the thought niggling in the back of my head comes to the fore."

    "It's clear now that I was being a fool, as usual, when dealing with my first crush. I definitely let those positively delightful feelings take over my life and obscure any better judgment."

    "Thinking grand poetic thoughts is one thing, but actually having a plan to make this next personal metamorphosis stick after botching all the others is quite another."

    mw "Field lacrosse has a larger field of play and defined positions. In sixes, everyone on the field plays both attacking and defending roles, but in field you have to specialize."

    C "Miss Woolsey, what positions are \"FW\" and \"MF\"?"
    mw "That would be \"forward\" and \"midfielder\". The forward is primarily concerned with scoring goals and the midfielder plays a little bit of both attacking and defending."
    mw "If you liked playing as you did in sixes, I would suggest that you request the midfielder position."
    "Miss Woolsey's advice makes sense to me, so I raise the pen toward my name to mark an \"MF\". Just as I am about to do that, however, I spy Tanya's name and the letters \"FW\" beside it."
    mw "You want to be a forward, Clover?"

    "Tanya is far too calm for my liking after my aggressive retort, so I look back to Miss Woolsey for support against her but receive only the opposite."
    mw "What Tanya means to say is that you will have to compete in tryouts with everyone else who wants to play forward, including Tanya."
    mw "We have to field a full team and there are only so many forward positions available, so anyone who doesn't make it will have to play a different position."
    "Tanya is good at playing on the attack, and even I can privately admit it to myself. It would be tough going up against her, let alone the older girls who have been playing longer."

    mi "Before I give any more instruction, let's see what you both can do! Clover, Tanya, are you both ready?"
    C "Ready!"
    T "Ready... I think."
    "Scooping a ball out of the bucket with my crosse, I make a show of cradling it skillfully as I approach the net with Tanya in it. On her face I see nothing but pure concentration, which I match equally."
    "With a quick shot to the upper left corner of the goal, the ball sails easily right past Tanya and into the back of the net."
    C "Score one for Clover!"
    "I have absolutely no qualms about celebrating my first score against Tanya even though I know it's only because she's moving slow and awkwardly in the unusually thick padding which she is unaccustomed to wearing."
    "My next few shots find the back of the net but eventually Tanya does start to get accustomed to the pads and learn to read my shots better."
    S "You've got this, Clover!"
    "Sibyl yells out encouragement for me from way back atop the bleachers after a series of consecutive blocked shots. It helps keep my spirits up but doesn't make the ball end up in the back of the net any more frequently."
    mi "Hold it there for a moment, Clover. It looks like you're getting the hand of it now, Tanya. Please share what you have learned."
    "Taking the helmet off, I can see the sweat building on her face. While I was having fun taking free shots, Tanya was clearly putting in lots of work blocking them."
    T "Water first, and then..."
    "Tanya doesn't even finish her sentence, instead immediately grabbing for her bottle to suck down replacement for all the moisture she's losing. After catching her breath, Tanya elaborates further."
    T "It was difficult to guess where Clover was going to shoot the ball at first, but after she kept going I was able to get a better read on her intentions."
    T "Usually, wherever she's looking or the direction her crosse is facing will be where she's going to shoot the ball."
    mi "Exactly! Clover, you need to be more careful about how many tells you are giving away when you go to take your shots."
    C "Yes, Miss Izzie!"
    "I know this already of course. It's not like Miss Woolsey hasn't instructed me on how to fake out the goaltender when I make a shot, but I've also never mastered the ability either."
    "It is unsurprisingly difficult to shoot accurately when you're not focused on where you want the ball to go, and getting too aggressive with faking stick movements too often leads to me dropping the ball."
    C "(I've been working hard to improve my cradling. Maybe I can do it better now?)"
    "When Miss Izzie starts us off again, I lift up a ball in my crosse and cradle it in front of Tanya and the goal."
    "Testing out Tanya's responsiveness, I juke suddenly to the left to fake a shot which never leaves my crosse. Rather than flinch to my left where my throw would have gone, Tanya jerks slightly to my right."
    C "(She's expecting me to try to fake her out with my throw, huh?)"
    "Taking advantage of Tanya's assumptions, I throw a simple shot full force to the left side exactly where I am looking, and opposite of the way Tanya moves to try to intercept."
    mi "Don't let your guard down, Tanya! Sometimes even the fake outs can be fake!"
    "I try out a series of trick shots with my next few balls, sometimes faking where I am going to throw, and sometimes not."
    C "(It's kind of fun messing with Tanya's mind like this!)"
    "When the bucket of balls finally runs dry, Miss izzie calls us both over to review what we learned."
    T "I was skeptical at first, but now that I've been in the net I do understand better how the goaltender might read my shots."
    mi "Exactly as I'd hoped you would! I'm a genius, aren't I?"
    C "And I've learned a few new tricks myself. I can't wait to try them out in a real match!"
    mi "You did good out there, Clover, but remember that you'll also have defenders to contend with in a real match."
    mi "You won't always be able to take the time setting up a shot like you can here one-on-one, but as you develop your shooting skills it will come more naturally to you in the moment."
    "After my boasting earlier, I know that Tanya will not go easy on me when the time comes for my turn in the goal."
    C "(These pads are so heavy! How do our goalies manage to save {b}anything{/b} while weighed down with all this? I can barely see out of the mask!)"
    "The first few shots out of Tanya all whiz past me. I don't get angry and try to stay calm, knowing that this is all part of my adjusting to the new equipment."
    "Instead, I try to focus on Tanya's footwork, her line of sight, and how she cradles the ball in her crosse."
    "Tanya has the benefit of having been in the net first to know exactly what my weaknesses as the goaltender will be, but I also have the benefit of knowing what we've both just learned from Miss Izzie too."
    "The first time that I stop one of Tanya's shots, I celebrate in the disappointed look which fills her face, and when I block the next one too, I even slap the goaltender's crosse against the goal in celebration."
    S "You can do it, Tanya!"
    "The big-hearted Sibyl of course wouldn't cheer for her Vertu any more than her other best friend, so I don't let it get to me and return my focus to Tanya and the ball cradled skillfully in her crosse."
    "Although it has no effect on me, Sibyl's encouragement does seem to improve Tanya's shots. She wins a lucky streak where I don't manage to block a single one."
    C "Hold up! I need a break!"
    "With no end to the shots from Tanya coming and sweat beginning to pour down my forehead, I wave off the assault to rip off the helmet and down half my water bottle in one go."
    C "(And I thought running around so much was tiring! How can it be so draining just staying in one place!?)"
    mw "That's good for today, girls! Curfew is coming up soon so you'd better start packing it up!"
    "I am all too eager to get out of the stifling goaltender equipment when Miss Woolsey calls out from across the gym. I make right away to strip it all off and help Miss Izzie pack it back on the cart."
    C "Thank you for helping us train today, Miss Izzie."
    "Perhaps as an apology for how I was thinking that my art teacher could in no way help me be a better lacrosse player, I voice my thanks to the very same for everything she did today."
    C "(Miss Izzie and Miss Woolsey used their free time to help us. It's only fair that I thank her for it.)"
    mi "No problem! But now you owe me."
    C "W-What!?"
    mi "Just kidding! Maybe. Anyway, Tanya—"
    T "Yes?"
    "I didn't notice Tanya approaching at all until Miss Izzie calls out to her. Suddenly she's right beside me, lugging the big bucket of lacrosse balls back to the waiting equipment cart before us."
    mi "You both worked hard out there today! If you sweat half as much during our homecoming game, my Wild Roses are sure to win!"
    mw "{b}Your{/b} Wild Roses?"
    "For the second time in as many minutes, I am surprised to hear another person come up right to me while I'm distracted by separating myself from the goaltending pads."
    mi "I taught you everything you know about lacrosse, Nao-chan — I mean, Miss Woolsey. So, maybe... {b}our{/b} team?"
    "My two teachers go back and forth amicably about the team and our chances in the \"homecoming\" match. When I finish stacking it up on the cart, Miss Izzie catches out attention again."
    mi "You've still got time to shower off before the curfew bell. It's just the two of you today so take your time. I dunno, maybe save some water and shower together?"
    "Miss Izzie starts speaking simply enough but trails off quickly towards the end with a soft shove against Tanya's shoulder in my direction. Tanya brushes off the prod with a soft glare back at Miss Izzie."
    T "I'm going to wait until I get back to my room."
    C "Yeah, me too."
    "It was awkward enough having to change when it was just the two of us in the locker room. Having to shower like that would be on par with psychological torture."
    "When Miss Izzie and Miss Woolsey depart to return the equipment, Sibyl finally speaks up for herself."
    S "You both played {b}amazingly{/b} today! Those other girls at the tryouts better bring their A-game!"
    C "Thanks, Sibyl! When the time comes, I'll show them all!"
    "Tanya thanks Sibyl for her vote of confidence. Although she remains silent about my enthusiastic declaration, I can tell by her sharp glance my way that she doesn't quite approve of it."
    T "We're a good team but homecoming is going to be tough despite what Miss Izzie says."
    C "What's so special about \"homecoming\"?"
    T "Do you seriously not know what {b}homecoming{/b} is, Clover? Didn't they did it at your old school?"
    C "I so too know what homecoming is! I just never did it at my old school, okay?"
    "I honestly have very little idea what homecoming is at all. I know it has something to do with sports and the preppy girls made a big fuss about it every year."
    C "(Technically I'm a \"preppy\" girl now, aren't I?)"
    "That thought alone makes the occult goth girl inside shudder with disgust."
    S "At my old schools, we had our homecoming events in October."
    T "Our first home lacrosse match became the academy's version of homecoming since we don't have any winter sports teams here."
    "I file away somewhere in the depths of my head the knowledge that our first home game will be something really special, and also that I need to be a superstar lacrosse player by then so I can show off."
    S "You both must be starving after all that exercise, right? I smuggled a few muffins back to our room, so if you're quick in the locker room we can all eat some together before the curfew bell!"

    S "What do you mean, Clover?"

    T "Athletes don't throw in the towel at the first setback, Sibyl."
    C "You think it's that {b}easy{/b}, huh!? You think I've never {b}tried{/b} to stop feeling that way!?"
    "It's bad enough that I've had to expose my critical weakness to Tanya, and now she's demeaning me for it too."
    T "But you've been just fine in every single practice!"

    "If someone had asked me to the dance, I'd probably feel happy about it in a way. I might even have decided to attend as her date. In the end, though, no one asked me the whole week."
    C "(Except Tanya, and that doesn't count!)"
    S "Hey, Clover?"
    C "Yeah?"
    "Having finished with her hair, Sibyl starts gathering her things like she's going out, despite the dance being a painfully short hour away."
    S "Try to keep an open mind, will you?"
    C "About what?"
    S "About the dance. About trying to work through your social anxiety. About... Tanya."
    C "What about her?"
    S "Just give her a chance, please?"
    S "One of my foster sisters once told me: \"Sibyl, if you think only of what can go wrong, you'll find that it always does goes wrong. Start thinking about what can go right instead.\""
    "As Sibyl recounts the lesson from her foster sibling, her voice alters just slightly for the words imparted to her by someone obviously very trusted to her."
    S "You may face many difficult situations this evening, if if you keep your head up it will be much easier to navigate the rough patches and steer toward the clear waters."
    C "(Since when did Sibyl have all this sage advice stuffed in her head?)"
    S "Well, that's it for me. Tanya said she'd meet you in the lounge at ten before. I'll see you in an hour!"
    C "Wait! Where are you going!?"
    S "Honestly, Clover, do you ever listen to anything anymore? I told you on Tuesday that the art club was helping set preparation for the dance."
    "Now that she mentions it, I do sort of remember Sibyl telling me that the dance was themed and that the art club was making props."
    "Every I thought about that wasn't about lacrosse this week is probably gone from my brain forever."
    C "Right. I'll catch you at the dance, Sibyl!"
    "I try to see Sibyl off with a smile and enthusiasm, but once she leaves I'm left with a sinking dread about what comes next."
    C "(I have to go to the dance with Tanya... alone?)"
    "It was one thing for all three of us to go together, but if it's just me and Tanya it'll really starts to feel like a {b}date{/b} date."
    C "(Relax, she's just doing this for Sibyl's sake, remember? She probably doesn't think anything of it. I doubt she'll even show up to the lounge at all. Yeah.)"

    "When the moment of truth arrives, I set out from my dorm room toward the dormitory lounge by the big doors to the building entrance."
    C "(There's no way she's going to be here, right?)"
