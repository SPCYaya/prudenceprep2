    "My legs walk on auto pilot while I dream up grand strategies and plans for throwing my victory in the faces of all my doubters — mostly the latter."
    "My daydreams all come to an end when my subconscious brain walks me right up to the subject of my thoughts, suddenly face to face with Sibyl."
    C "Eyeep!"
    "A little squeal of surprise leaks from my lips from having to directly confront the girl who has my thoughts mixed together and churned up so thoroughly."
    S "Good morning, Clover! Are you feeling better today?"
    "After fending off her concerns for my supposed illness, I sit down at my desk to try to actually do some of that homework which I had blown off yesterday."
    C "(The sine is... the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.)"
    C "(...Hippopotenuse. Sibyl would think that's funny.)"
    "My fingers flick my mechanical pencil against a printed diagram of a right triangle while my gaze flicks aside to where Sibyl reclines on her bed."
    "Having finished her own homework last night while I was in bed pretending to be sick, Sibyl's only care now is sweeping her beautiful blue eyes now from side to side as she reads through the lines of her latest novel."
    C "(Homework now, Sibyl later.)"
    "Turning back to the worksheets before me, I try to wrap my head around trigonometry once again. Deep in thought, I pencil in a \"C\" at one end of a hypotenuse, and \"S\" at the other. On the right angle, I draw in a small \"T\" as an aside."
    C "(Hmm...)"
    "I stare at the labelled right triangle so long that the image gets burned into my brain, but nothing comes to mind that will make the hypotenuse shorter and brings those two letters together."
    "Fully giving up on trigonometry, I begin to take a different approach to my other problem by picking up my smartphone and flipping to a fresh page of my notebook."
    "The keyboard on my screen flickers to life as I search the depths of the internet for what it is that I need to learn most: \"how to make a girl fall in love with you\"."
    C "(\"Six Simple Steps\"? Is that all it takes?)"
    "I jot down the highlights into a series of bullet points and leave plenty of space in between to fill in my notes."
    C "(Step One: Be yourself!)"
    "There's a whole paragraph that follows it, but I skip reading all that in its entirety because I've never been anyone else than me."
    "In the empty lines I left to take notes of what I should do to fulfill the first step I draw a giant check mark to take up the space."
    C "(Step Two: Look good and feel good!)"
    "Sibyl might be far and away more beautiful with her soft, fluffy hair and eyes that anyone would get lost in, but I think I'm decently pretty. I might even be more than decent after ditching the goth gear."
    C "(Blondes are pretty popular, right? So I've got that going for me too.)"
    "As far as \"feeling\" good, that's easy. I haven't felt as good as I do now since before all the nastiness of the fallout with my middle school friends and my parents' divorce."
    "What is supposed to be an optimistic thought unexpectedly still strikes at surprisingly deep wounds even after having thought I'd made peace with them."
    C "(Sibyl has it worse than me. She never even knew her parents.)"
    "It comes to me suddenly that I don't know whether Sibyl was an orphan from birth or if she lost her family as a child. For now, it's just another thing I will learn about her once I've captured her affection."
    "My pen scrawls out a slightly more modest check mark for the second step of the list."
    C "(Step Three: Take an interest in her!)"
    "I have to read further on with this one because obviously I'm interested in her or I wouldn't be here searching on the web for how to make her take an interest back in me."
    "The explanation is a little too vague for my liking, but I think what the step wants me to do is be open and communicative, and also take an interest in her life and hobbies."
    C "(I've already been doing that, but I can do more too!)"
    "With a broad smile, I give step three another big check mark. Proud of myself, I snatch another gaze aside at the girl I'm definitely going to win over to reward myself for being so well ahead of all the steps."
    C "(Step Four: Befriend her friends!)"
    "I have to re-read step four more times to be sure that I read it correctly at first. The words don't change no matter how many times I read them."
    "The nervous habit of tapping my pencil against the paper emerges once again as I stare into the blank lines I left under the step. I know what I need to write in there but lack the courage to do so."
    C "(If it means making Sibyl mine... I will do it.)"
    "In small print I write simply, \"befriend Tanya\"."
    C "(Enough of that. Step Five: Be flirtatious!)"
    "Once again, I physically blink at the outrageously simple heading for something so impossibly difficult."
    C "(Why does it just assume I know how to flirt?)"
    "I read through the paragraph below the header for more details. It's clearly written for a guy but isn't not entirely unhelpful for me either."
    C "(\"Make her know you're interested in more than friendship.\" Smiling, frequent eye contact, playful comments...)"
    "I read on further to try to find out how this is any different from normal friendship, but entirely fail to understand what makes flirting \"flirting\"."
    C "(And the first three steps were going so smoothly too...)"
    "Ultimately, I just note it down as something to do more research on later so I can forge ahead to potentially easier to accomplish tasks."
    C "(Step Six: Get physical!)"
    "At first I think this step means something salacious, but it turns out to be all about using small touches to increase our physical bond. I'm confident enough that I can work simple touches into our everyday routines somehow."
    C "Okay, done! Now I just need to work on those few tricky parts."
    "Skipping quickly over step four, I review the other steps to my master seduction plan and decide to put it into practice right away."
    C "Sibyl!"
    "My crush's name slips smooth as silk from my lips as I walk over to her bed. Her attention draws away from her novel and onto me, just as planned."
    S "What's up, Clover? Need some help with the homework?"

    S "Is there something wrong with the other side of the table, Clover?"
    C "No. I just felt like sitting next to you today."
    "In truth, I prefer to sit opposite Sibyl where I can enjoy each expression on her face as she converses with Tanya. I have recently taken to cherishing the moments when her cheeks puff up wth laughter or her eyebrows raise high with surprise."
    S "That's all well and good, but I feel like a sardine."

    C "So what are all these vials for?"
    "I feel like an idiot asking about it after having literally just been instructed by the teacher, but the tray full of small vials of differently colored mystery liquids Sibyl sets at our lab station are unlabelled and I wasn't paying attention."
    S "Were you even listening during the lecture?"
    "It's so hard to concentrate when our science teacher starts droning on, and now that I understand how I feel about Sibyl it's so much easier to get lost in her auburn curls."
    C "Sorry. I kinda zoned out."
    S "You've been kinda spacey lately, Clover. Are you sure you're alright?"
    "I try again to reassure her that I'm just fine without giving away my strong new feelings for her. I still need to ensure she's ready to accept them."
    S "The abstract for the experiment should go over the basics. Please read through it while I sort these out."
    "Lifting up the page, I read the title of the experiment we are doing today — {i}Determining Acidity by Titration with an Indicator Solution{/i}."
    C "What's a \"tit-ration\"."
    S "{b}Titration{/b}."
    "Sibyl corrects me quickly, probably embarrassed at my phrasing given how she glances around to see if anyone heard me say that aloud."
    S "\"Titration\" is the process of determining the concentration of a substance in a solution by reacting it with a solution of known concentration."
    S "For the purposes of our lab, we are going to first note the change of color as we add the \"titrant\"."
    C "(Tit-rant.)"
    "I must be feeling extras stupid today. Every since discovering how I feel about Sibyl it's just about all I can think about."
    "Sibyl goes on to explain even more about the experiment, but it only half gets through my head as I zone out once more to focus on how pretty she looks while concentrating."
    C "(She's doing it again!)"
    "Sibyl has this funny mannerism during periods of intense concentration where her tongue just barely sticks out from between her teeth to be held lightly with her lips."
    "Usually this comes out when she's focused on something intricate with her artwork, but now it's because she's trying hard to slowly count out drops from a pipette."
    S "There we go! Would you like to do the honors, Clover?"
    C "Huh? Oh, sure..."
    "Sibyl finishes up whatever she's doing while I'm still gawking. I try to cover up my absentmindedness by pretending I know what I'm volunteering for with the next task."
    C "Remind me again how I should do this part?"
    S "Just one drop at time from the pipette. I'll tell you when to stop."
    "The click of a pen tells me it's time to go. I squeeze the dropper ever so slightly and let one drop loose, then turn back expectantly toward Sibyl."
    S "Keep going."
    "We do this a few more times until Sibyl suddenly tells me to hold off. Showing me her notes, she points out the difference in color between the new vial and our control vial."
    S "With this, we can do a small calculation to estimate the concentration difference and plot a titration curve!"
    C "Sibyl, you're a genius!"
    "Sibyl beams at the compliment. What I tell her is no mere flattery; things that make no sense to me suddenly aren't so scary once Sibyl explains them."
    C "Can you just marry me so I don't have to think so hard ever again."
    "With her genial mood as it is I try to squeeze in a little flirting, like planting the idea of marriage in her mind while playing it off as a joke."
    "I even try to reduce the physical distance between us by taking her free hand while she's writing so that I can examine her ring finger."
    "It's all in good fun, I believe, but the falter in a newly cautious smile upon Sibyl's face tells a very different story than what I'd hoped would play out."
    S "You have to learn all this for yourself, Clover. I will not always be around to teach you."
    "Sibyl withdraws the hand I took of hers to bring back close to her chest, then turns away from me to finish writing down the details of our experimental results."
    C "(She's just worried about my performance on our exams, right?)"
    "While I am left wondering about the shift in mood behind Sibyl's back, I spot Tanya and Sierra at the far end of the room."
    "Something clearly has gone wrong because Tanya's face is dripping wet with one of the colored solutions and she's angrily brandishing one of those tubes which Sibyl calls a {i}burette{/i} at Sierra."
    S "Would you like to review my work, Clover?"
    "Sibyl turns to offer the worksheet out to me to verify our lab findings. It doesn't make any real sense to me, but it's good to see Sibyl return to her usual self once again."

    "I keep on trying my hardest to break through to Sibyl, but my efforts seem only to be doing the opposite. Rather than make her fall in love wih me, I feel like she is only getting pushed further away."
    "I know I'm not exactly an expert at seduction, but Sibyl really is a total brick wall. She's not picking up on a single thing I say or do."
    C "(There's not a single lousy article about same-sex relationships in any of these {i}Girls' Mix{/i} issues!)"
    "While picking through a stack of magazines in the library one evening, I come across a book title which I think I can use to flirt with Sibyl."
    C "Hey, Sibyl check it out! I didn't know they wrote a book about you?"
    "I hold back the book for just long enough to pique her interest and draw her attention away from the new novel she picked up just a few minutes ago."
    C "It's {i}A Little Princess{/i}. Because you're so cute and good at etiquette class. Get it?"
    "I wave the book I found in front of Sibyl, but her expression remains particularly stony."
    S "You don't know anything about that book, do you?"
    C "Well the... girl on the cover kind of looks like you, doesn't she?"
    S "That novel is about a girl who suddenly becomes an orphan and all the terrible misfortunes that it brings."
    C "O-Oh sorry, I didn't realize..."
    "I quickly stuff the book behind my back and offer Sibyl the most sheepish apology ever granted in all of history."
    C "(Way to go, Clover! You picked the worst book possible.)"
    "I've been trying to leave Sibyl out of my family life for now after having early made such a big fuss about my parents' divorce and then showing her all the things they sent me to show they love me."
    S "It's okay, Clover. I know you didn't mean anything by it. And the story ends well enough I suppose."
    "Somehow I am not surprised at all that Sibyl has read this random book I pulled off the shelves. Knowing now that it is about an orphan girl, perhaps it is not mere coincidence."
    S "I'm fine with it, you know? Being an orphan, I mean. My foster families have always been kind and welcoming."
    "This topic is something I've rarely heard Sibyl bring up. She always seems rather positive about it, but somehow I feel like there's a distinct lack of depth behind the smile."
    C "(Sibyl always seems to be looking down when she speaks about her birth family. I'd rather see her looking up!)"
    "When I sit down across the table from Sibyl, she turns her head back up again, peering right into my eyes."
    S "I'm spoiling the mood, aren't I? I can read it on your face, you know."
    S "Take comfort in the knowledge that I am doing well just the way I am. I have a big future ahead of me and lots of plans, so don't you worry."
    "Seeing Sibyl cheer up goes a long way to helping me shake off the awkwardness of my blunder just moments before."
    C "What sort of plans do you have, Sibyl? Are you going to be an award-winning author? Or maybe some kind of famous artist?"
    "I've never heard any of these grand plans Sibyl has, so naturally it's all I really want to hear about when she brings it up so suddenly."
    S "I do not believe I am skilled enough for any of that."
    C "You're skilled enough! You're way skilled enough!"
    "Sibyl laughs softly and tells me to calm down, then reiterates that her art isn't anything special despite my renewed protests."
    S "What I mean is that I want to be a mother. Some day I am going to have a big, happy family, and I'll be the best mother in the world."
    "Unlike before when she was looking down, with her head held up I can now see the warmth return to pool behind Sibyl's cool blue eyes."
    C "You'll be the best foster mother ever, I'm sure of it."
    S "I may foster some children, but I want my own children to love too. I want them more than anything."
    C "Y-Yeah, science is getting pretty good these days."
    "My reply comes out loose and mumbling. I can feel my body go stiff and hands clam up as I sit at the table across from Sibyl."
    "Perhaps Sibyl notices me going rigor mortis because she reaches across to take my hand, an action which instantly revives me with her warmth."
    S "Clover, you will always be my friend. No matter what happens, know that I will {b}always{/b} be here for you. I hope I can count on the same from you."
    "In the moment, I can only pray she doesn't feel my hand tremble when she says the word \"friend\"."
    C "(Yeah, I want to be her friend. I want to be her {b}girl{/b}friend!)"
    "I try to play it cool but my brain is screaming out to tell her I need to be more than \"friends\" with her. At the same time, some small part of me is telling my brain that I should keep my mouth shut or else risk ruining everything."
    C "Of course, Sibyl. You're my best friend in the world."
    "Sibyl smiles so brightly when I reply to her that all other thoughts completely leave my mind. She releases my hand herself after I fail to do it on my own."
    "I sit there for what must be a few minutes but instead feels like hours, just contemplating the short exchange we shared while Sibyl silently returns to her novel across from me."
    "The only conclusion that I arrive at is that I will have to resort to the one thing I most wish I would not have to if I'm going to be serious about making Sibyl love me."

    H "Sibyl does not seem the type to respond well to pick up lines."
    "I'm a little surprised at how rationally Vittoria is listening to me. It occurs to me that it's quite possible that how I have reacted to their teasing in the past only encourages she and her sister to act out further."

    C "Ugh!"
    "Vincenza must know that for a stubborn and spirited girl like me this is most truly the worst possible thing she could ask, and so here she is asking for me to willingly have my dignity debased before them."
    "I knew I wouldn't like whatever the price of this would be, and sure enough, I don't like it. The alternative, however, would be to let go of my love for Sibyl forever, and that is not an option."

    C "I want to do it!"
    "I cannot begin to comprehend what Sibyl must be thinking, but in the end she agrees to model me and wanders off to the storeroom to fetch clay for the project."
    T "I'm seriously going to murder you."
    "Tanya makes her feelings about the situation clear the moment Sibyl leaves the two of us alone."
    C "Not before I get felt up all over by Sibyl, you're not."
    "It is expressly clear that Tanya has yet more to say, but Sibyl returns quickly enough that she just goes back to her painting while also keeping a sharp eye on the two of us."
    C "S-So do you want me to... s-strip here, or...?"
    "Now that it's come down to it, I'm starting to feel self-conscious about the prospect of stripping down right in the middle of art class, even if it means Sibyl touching my naked body."
    "The combination of lacrosse exercise and fewer French toast breakfasts has been working like a charm, but I'm still not that confident in my body."
    S "Strip? I'm just doing a bust, Clover."
    C "B-Bust...?"
    "My hands raise up to my chest without thinking. My breasts aren't anything particularly special but it would still be awkward to take my top off here."
    "The first sign that I have a terrible misconception of what Sibyl wants to do is when I hear Tanya's viciously mirthful snickering from nearby."
    S "No, I mean a sculpture bust. That's just your shoulder on up. You won't need to take anything off at all."
    C "O-Oh...."
    "I know that my face must be burning crimson but Sibyl doesn't call me on it, instead just getting her workspace set up while I sit patiently trying not to squirm in my chair."
    "When the time finally comes to begin, Sibyl merely stands before me visually inspecting me all over but not touching one bit."
    C "I thought you were supposed to, umm, touch me."
    S "Yes, you're right, but... hmm, I just don't know where to start."
    "I suddenly realize that it's not just me who is anxious about this whole thing and that maybe my uneasiness might be taking Sibyl off her game as well."

    S "Are you alright?"
    C "Sorry, your fingers are just a little cold."
    S "You do feel warm."
    "Pausing for the moment, Sibyl rubs her hands together vigorously to warm them up, then reaches out to start touching my face again."
    "It's embarrassing and a totally weird feeling, the way she pulls and prods at my flesh, trying to feel the curves and contours of my face."
    C "(Is she going to mold the clay or mold my face?)"
    "When she withdraws her hands for the first time to mold her clay, it suddenly feels even more strange to not have her hands working into my skin at all."
    C "(It was a good idea at least even if it didn't work out, Miss Izzie.)"
    "I still have no idea if my teacher really expected one of her students to strip down and fondle another, but she sure seemed enthusiastic about it."
    "As Sibyl returns to rubs her hands all around my face and down my neck, my eyes are drawn to her face. Her expression remains still and focused, much like when she works on her other art projects."
    C "(She's so close!)"
    "Even though the project goal is to sculpt by feel, Sibyl still puts her large blue eyes to work inspecting how my flesh reacts to probing by her fingers."
    "Her face is so incredibly close that I can smell her shampoo, and my heart once again starts beating into overdrive."
    C "(Her lips!)"
    "Right before me, that soft pink pout. I could lean just a little bit closer and touch her lips with my own."
    C "(Should I kiss her? Would she freak out? Can I play it off an an accident?)"
    "A multitude of thoughts in a similar fashion continue to play through my mind, devolving rapidly with my mental state."
    C "(Is the mood \"right\" now? Should I do it!)"
    "I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, but I can feel the opportunity slipping away quickly right before my eyes."
    C "(I'm going to kiss her, and then play it off real smooth... or maybe I should just tell her I love her right now?)"
    "I feel warm already, my heart coursing blood fast and strong through my body. Jitters return to my limbs as I try to hype myself up to do something risky and incredible."
    "And then Sibyl stops touching me to return to her clay. My single-minded focus breaks in intensity, and for the first time I notice both Tanya and Miss Izzie together stealthily watching from across the room."
    "Tanya has her arms crossed like she's sulking and sports an equally dark expression when she catches my line of sight, while Miss Izzie beside her flashes a peace sign at me when I look her way."
    S "I'm almost done the basic shape of the head and shoulders. How are you holding up, Clover?"
    C "Oh, umm, pretty good. Thanks."
    "I'm not at all \"pretty good\", but I can't exactly tell her that I was just about to surprise kiss her a few moments ago."
    "Now that I remember that I'm still in the middle of art class and have an audience of my peers, I just can't bring myself to attempt it anymore."
    C "(I'm sorry, Miss Izzie, I don't know what you intended for me to do but I just couldn't do any of it.)"
    "The whole setup by Miss Izzie ultimately does not result in any real progress with Sibyl, but what it does do is harden my resolve to be make Sibyl mine, by any means necessary."
    "I thought I was going to be able to make Sibyl fall for me naturally, just like how she charmed me so easily, but now I realize that may not work out so well at all."
    C "(Maybe I've been a little naive in thinking that all I need to do is surround her with my affection and she would automatically fall in love with me. I need to be confident. I need to be bold.)"

    "I quiver in my cocoon of sheets. This shelter has always felt so safe and secure before, but it's also never been tested against this sort of danger."
    C "Don't touch me!"
    H "Was that a reply just now, dearest sister?"
    O "Certainly not. Clover is, after all, completely unable to hear us."
    C "I wasn't replying. That was a totally random warning to stay away from me."
    O "Now that most certainly sounded like a reply, but no— I must be imaging it, for cotton is soundproof."
    H "It matters not. So long as Clover remains in her impenetrable bubble, we are free to play with Sibyl to our hearts' des—"
    C "{b}Don't you dare touch her!{/b}"
    "I whip my cocoon apart dramatically to stare down the twins, bursting from my sheets like a vengeful butterfly newly reborn from her silken shell."
    O "Relax, Clover, we are only teasing you."
    "Neither twins looks particularly surprised by my sudden reveal, much to my dismay. They both remain infuriatingly calm and collected at the bottom of my bed."
    H "We are merely here to look after you, honestly."
    "I flop back down sluggishly onto my bed facing the twins, relaxed but not off guard."
    C "What does it matter to you? Haven't you done enough already?"
    H "Is it not the president's duty to look after the well-being of her charges?"
    O "...And perhaps we do feel a touch responsible for how events unfolded."
    "I can practically feel the frown on my face further reduce into a scowl as I stare down the twins in silence."
    C "So you going to apologize?"
    "The twins flash a quick glance between one another then start on their apology, each taking half as would seem their custom."
    O "We are sorry for how things turned out, Clover."
    H "We should not have encouraged you while knowing this would likely be the result."
    "I accept the twins' apology wordlessly, though it does not console me any. I even suspect that maybe Ms. Woolsey or Miss Izzie put them up to it."
    C "(There's no way these two devil-women are doing this of their own accord.)"
    O "How are you feeling now, Clover?"
    H "What can we can do to ease your pain?"
    "The demand for them to vacate my room posthaste is nearly off my lips before I quickly consider otherwise."
    "As much as I think doom and gloom are sure to follow anytime I listen to the words these two have to speak, I'm also desperate for someone to tell me what I do now."
    C "...Tell me how to get over my feelings for her."
    "However intense the emotional turmoil was to start with, I have come to accept that I will have to go back to being simply Sibyl's friend and roommate."
    "Just because I accepted this conclusion, however, does not mean everything is now fine and dandy. My heart still feels like a sponge being wrung out every time I look at her or say her name."
    C "I know I can't be with her, so I just want these feelings to... {b}go away{/b}."
    "Once again the twins glance toward each other, then surprisingly turn away from each other, and finally back to stare in one another's eyes yet again."
    C "Well? After messing around with so many girls you must know everything about curing heartbreak by now."
    H "Coquettish flirting and sultry liaisons are merely an amusement to me. Any heartbreak after the fact is not mine."
    "Vittoria replies quickly, and in a rather uncharacteristically defensive tone. I'm almost certain she's holding something back."
    "Vincenza, having remained watching her sister's reply, now turns to answer me herself with an almost apologetic tone."
    O "Your feelings may never subside, Clover. You will likely continue to admire all those things which first drew you to Sibyl."
    O "However valid and true your love may be, certain circumstances mean that your feelings will never be accepted."
    "While way more sympathetic in tone, Vincenza has little better advice for managing my current predicament than her sister."
    C "So it's all hopeless? I don't want to leave Sibyl, but I feel like I'll go insane if I stay the way I am now."
    O "This may not sound much like a comfort now, but in time you will find another girl who makes you just as crazy in love as Sibyl did." 
    C "I see Sibyl's face every time I close my eyes. I feel the press of her lips just as vividly as when she was kissing me."
    H "Hold up, you kissed her?"
    O "{b}She{/b} kissed {b}you{/b}?"
    "Like a total dunce I spill the beans on my selfish request to Sibyl which she had selflessly granted despite not liking me in that way."
    C "You can't tell {b}anyone{/b}, least of all {b}Tanya{/b}."
    "I half plead, half demand that the twins keep their lips shut on the kiss as a whole with the knowledge that Tanya probably will murder me for real this time if she finds out."
    C "(At least this means I know I can trust Sibyl to not kiss and tell.)"
    "Under pressure from the twins, I relate a shortened version of what happened in exchange for an assurance of their secrecy regarding the matter."
    H "I must applaud you in this endeavor, Clover. You succeeded where Vincenza and I had not."
    "It feels good to have the twins voluntarily admit I'm their better in at least one way, but that feeling doesn't remain as the reminder that they once tried to put their moves on Sibyl follows."
    C "Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't gotten to kiss her? Sibyl is all I think about to the point where I just can't think clearly anymore."
    H "Have you tried schlicking it out? You might feel better after."
    C "Schl— What is that?"
    "I blink my confusion at Vittoria, who merely shares a small smirk and a giggle with her sister by her side."
    H "You know, \"digging for clams\"?"
    O "\"Petting the kitty\"?"
    H "\"Rehearsing finger puppets\"?"
    O "\"Whipping cream\"?"
    H "\"Taking a selfie\"?"

    "Vittoria and Vincenza both pause when I forcefully end their back and forth of euphemisms. It only took a few for me to catch on but they just wouldn't quit it."
    C "I know what you're getting at, and I— I tried it, but Sibyl was still in my mind the whole time."

    "I felt really guilty at the time doing \"that\" while thinking about Sibyl, but knowing in my mind that Sibyl would never actually touch me in the same way made the fantasy a little easier to bear."
    C "Maybe I just need to quickly find someone else, like you said. Someone who I can do these things with to take my mind off Sibyl."
    "It's not a conclusion I come to lightly, trying to give up on Sibyl by forcibly moving on, but from what the twins said it might just be the easiest."
    "To my surprise, Vittoria and Vincenza both immediately explain to me how this is, in their opinions, exactly the wrong way to go about it."
    H "That's called a \"rebound\", Clover, and jumping in bed with another girl while you're still emotionally vulnerable is a terrible idea."
    C "But you said I should move on and find someone else!"
    O "We did say so, but we meant after you fully come to terms with how things ended with Sibyl and are ready to move on."
    C "But you said I'd never get over Sibyl!"
    "The twins shut up for once in the face of my superb reasoning, but neither look particularly happy about it."
    C "If getting with another girl right away with stanch the flow of despair filling up my soul, then of course I want to do it!"
    H "Clover, you are hurting right now, but you shouldn't do anything you're going to regret later."
    C "(They tell me all these things about how it's not going to be easy to move on from Sibyl, then tell me the one way that I'll get over her, then tell me that I can't do it!?)"
    C "If I'm so \"emotionally vulnerable\" as you say, then why aren't you taking advantage of me right now? Isn't that what you're best at?"
    O "We are not nearly so heartless as you imagine us to be, Clover."
    "My heart rate reaches a peak yet again, having been slowly climbing over the last minute. After everything they've done, now of all times do the twins become reticent."
    C "I take back everything I told you before. Permission to touch: granted."
    "Both Vittoria and Vincenza balk at my sudden change of heart, looking more than mildly perturbed by the barely hidden meaning behind what I declared to them."
    H "You are not in a proper state of mind, Clover."
    O "Do not ask us to do something that we know will hurt you."
    C "I don't care. If you really came here to help me, then I want you to do this for me now. I want you to take my mind off Sibyl."
    "The twins understandably consult one another with their infuriating face-to-face meeting of their eyes, then tentatively turn back to me."
    H "Are you {b}sure{/b} that you want this, Clover?"
    O "Is this really how you want your first time to be?"
    "The twins correctly guessing that it's my \"first time\" only makes me more annoyed by their current resistance to do what I'm sure they normally do without a care."
    C "Yes, I am very sure!"

    "Vittoria locks eyes with me and begins crawling up the bed toward me on her hands and knees like a lioness stalking her prey. She's quick to pull my legs out from under me and tease her hands up them without delay."
    "Vincenza, who chose to stand from the edge of the bed, now sits down again upon it beside me, and with one hand turns my face away from her sister towards her own."
    O "Close your eyes, Clover."
    "I do as Vincenza asks, though I find it increasingly hard to calm down as Vittoria creeps higher and higher up my thighs without showing any sign of slowing down."
    "The now-familiar sensation of lips pressed against my own returns, feeling much like the way Sibyl kissed me but also much more than that kiss at the same time."
    "The tip of Vincenza's tongue glides with a slight pressure across my upper lip, driving me to release a soft whimper in response. She next pinches my lower lip between hers, sucking on it ever so faintly to drive my senses wild."
    "I want to kiss so much more, and so much more deeply, but Vincenza holds herself back like the maddening tease she is."
    "A soft pressure alights on my shoulders, which I quickly realize to be Vincenza's hands. I just barely crack my eyes open when she pushes her weight forward against me, knocking me onto my back with my legs splayed out below me."

    "Greedy fingers take the opportunity to tug my undergarments effortlessly over my hips while equally rapacious lips return to stifle the breathy whimpers of desire which bubble up from my chest."

    "When Sibyl does eventually come sweeping back through the door to our room, it's with a perhaps contradictory relief that I feel a prickle of thorny pain in my chest upon seeing her face."

    "The prickle returns again when she smiles so brightly back to me as she does, but it too fades once again into the calmness of knowing that Sibyl is and always will be special to me."
