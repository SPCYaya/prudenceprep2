    "Vittoria locks eyes with me and begins crawling up the bed toward me on her hands and knees like a lioness stalking her prey. She's quick to pull my legs out from under me and tease her hands up them without delay."
    "Vincenza, who chooses to stand from the edge of the bed, moves to sit down again upon it beside my shoulder, and with one hand turns my face away from her sister towards her own."

    "The tip of Vincenza's tongue glides with a slight pressure across my upper lip, driving me to release a soft whimper in response. She next pinches my lower lip between hers, sucking on it ever so faintly to drive my senses wild."
    "I want to kiss so much more, and so much more deeply, but Vincenza holds herself back like the maddening tease she and her sister are."
    "A soft pressure alights on my shoulders, which I quickly realize to be Vincenza's hands. I just barely crack my eyes open when she pushes her weight forward against me, knocking me onto my back with my legs splayed out below me."
    H "Surrender yourself to us."
    "Vittoria inserts herself into the space between my spread legs such that I cannot squeeze them back together without her pulling them apart again."
    "Her hands glide eagerly up under my uniform, over the curve of my hips, and up to quiver my stomach where her touch tickles at my waist."
    "Greedy fingers take the opportunity to tug my undergarments effortlessly over my hips while equally rapacious lips return to stifle the breathy whimpers of desire which bubble up from my chest."
    "My heartbreak-wearied mind races once more, alight with new-found discoveries of sensations previously unknown."
