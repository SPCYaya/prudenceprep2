    "A warm breath puffs out between my chapped lips, a soft wisp born into the frigid late January air. Snowflakes flutter before me with the disturbance in the air."
    C "And now it's snowing too. Wonderful."
    "Another particularly heavy huff flutters through the straight cut bangs of my flaxen blonde hair, sending little white flakes fluttering down before me."
    "I stop where I am to ruffle my hair back and forth, casting off all the snow which had started to accumulate atop my head."
    "Then, with a frown solidly plastered on my face, I hump the duffel strap more securely over my shoulder and continue down the long wooded lane."
    C "(\"When we were your age, we walked to school up hill both ways in the snow!\")"
    "I can almost hear the voice of my grandparents in my mind as I trudge along slowly toward the school I'm transferring into part way through freshman year of high school."
    "I'm already dressed in my new uniform: an exceptionally cutesy pink and white outfit which is totally unlike what I used to wear back at my old school, and most especially how I dressed in middle school."
    "Just about everything related to this sudden transfer has been a headache but the new uniform is secretly something I actually kind of like — with one exception."
    "Whether the size is wrong for my awkward body or because I'm undertaking this long trek while lugging my entire worldly belongings, the warm white tights just are {b}not{/b} cooperating."
    "I perform an clumsy half jig for a few steps in a futile attempt trying to correct the tights around my legs as I walk."
    C "(Drooping here, bunching there...)"
    "Ever since I was told that I'd be going here, I've put off trying on the new uniform like that would mean I wouldn't have to go. Now I'm paying for it with ill-fitted clothing."
    "A wave of relief washes over me when I spy the forms of the stately buildings of Prudence Preparatory Academy emerging from the white cover of light snowfall just ahead."
    "Beside what are likely the school buildings, there is also a small chapel with a grand statue of some saint or another out front."
    C "(They surely have a car that could have met me at the gate rather than make me suffer exposure to the elements.)"
    "After finally having enough of the annoyance, I stop right there in the walkway to dig my fingers into the uniform inelegantly, pinching and digging at the tight fabric which runs up to my waist."
    g1 "Dear me, Vincenza, and in sight of the Virgin Mary too."
    g2 "The Virgin Mary always watches over us, Vittoria."
    "Unexpectedly out of the lazy snow flurries floats a pair of voices and a titter of laughter against the quiet of the evening dusting of a snowfall."
    "I almost think I'm starting to hear things, but before my mind can process it any further a sudden weight presses around the back of my neck and upon my shoulders."
    O "The proper young ladies of the academy do such things in the confines of their own rooms."
    "The second girl, addressed as Vincenza, is close enough for me to feel the warmth of her breath tickle the left side of my face."
    "Flipping my head suddenly to the side, I catch sight of the face of the girl in question. She wears a soft grin upon a graceful face with relaxed eyes. She's pretty, but restrained; cool but confident."
    "From her head falls a stream of fine golden hair down her back, styled with a neat ponytail in a kind of boyish look that oddly doesn't contrast at all with the uniform." 
    H "Maybe she isn't a proper young lady at all?"
    "A soft touch against the small of my back announces the arrival of the other girl, and it remains as she swoops close across my other side in a flutter of voluminous silvery curls toward my front."
    "When my head flips back the other way, I find that this girl, Vittoria, shares similar features to the first, albeit with a very different, much more feminine aura also very much suited to the uniform."
    C "(They're almost... otherworldy beautiful.)"
    "The first thought through my brain is that they must be sisters, if not twins, and the clearly foreign accent common between them only adds to the similarity."
    "Without warning, the ponytail girl draws close to my face while reaching a hand toward my chin to guide my head this way and that to inspect of my features."
    O "Do your eyes need a check, Vittoria? I dare say she's just your type."
    H "A young lady for sure, Vincenza, but the question of her {b}propriety{/b} remains inconclusive."
    C "What... what is happening?"
    "I'm so caught off guard by the sudden appearance of these two girls and their heedless invasion of my personal space that I freeze in place, unsure what reaction such a strange situation calls for."
    O "You've kept us waiting, Clover. We have a very important rendezvous to make."
    C "(They know my name!?)"
    "The pair continue on their back and forth with barely an acknowledgement of their brash invasion of my personal space. That one of them somewhat acknowledged my question is a start at least."
    C "(Is getting this close... {b}normal{/b} for Europeans?)"
    "With her right arm still heavy around my shoulders, her left heedlessly picks at the leftmost strap of my jumper skirt, following it slowly all the way up my chest."
    "I might have totally forgotten that I had my uniform hiked up to pick at my tights when I was suddenly beset upon, but the girl on my right certainly hasn't."
    C "My bus was late— {b}hey{/b}!"
    H "Oh my, and with your uniform so disarrayed. Please allow me to assist."
    "When I try to politely brush off the handsy probing of the girl slumped across my shoulders, the other one suddenly becomes even more invasive."
    "The hand of hers which isn't on my small of my back brushes against my own still fighting to fix my tights, only to go further still in picking up where I had left off."
    H "You want to make a good first impression for your Vertu, isn't that right? You simply must look your best."
    "She pulls at the tights bunching around my knees and slides the palm of her hand up my leg with it, smoothing the thin material across my legs."
    "My cold thighs tingle with the sleekness of her touch but I am otherwise struck stiff with the surprise of someone gliding her hand way up to places strangers would not normally dare."
    O "The poor little thing's frozen solid. Can we not keep her just a little longer, Vittoria, to warm her up?"
    "The strap of my jumper is released from the second girl's fingers, but just as I think she's about to let me go she instead trails her fingers reach to straighten the pink necktie around my neck."
    C "Eueh...!"
    "A strange sound emerges from my lips as a consequence of all this off attention. It too transforms into a soft puff of warm breath in the cold air before me."
    "To say I'm flustered is an understatement. I'm not usually one who likes touchy-feely types like my grandma, and this is going {b}way{/b} beyond the forehead kisses she is known for."
    H "We were only asked to deliver her room key, Vincenza, and we are late ourselves as you rightly pointed out."
    "The first girl's palm glides well higher than it has any right to up the inside of my thigh, and still further beyond to flatten out with the tights out around my hip."
    "A small shudder passes through my body from my ear into which the one girl, Vincenza, keeps speaking into, all the way down to the hand pressed closely upon the small of my back."
    O "Pity..."
    "Distracted and slowed from logical thought by the strange caresses all over my body, it's only then that my brain come to the heart of the matter."
    C "W-Wait, room key?"
    "With a soft giggle, the first girl's fingers clip against my stomach where the white tights meet their end, followed by the hard, cold touch of something entirely unnatural against my bare skin."
    "I quiver instinctively against the harshly frigid metal wedged between my skin and my tights, breaking the dumb stupor the mysterious pair of girls had put me in."
    C "H-Hyah! What did you—!?"
    "The heavy duffel strap still slung over my unmolested shoulder finally drops off as I shake about like mad trying to fish out the object burning cold against the warm skin inside my tights."
    "I hold the offending item up before my face after extracting it to find a plastic id card with my face on it staring back and a metal carabiner attached to it."
    C "(Room key.)"
    "Once my thought processes finally catches up to my comprehension of the object I'm currently holding, I spin about to let those handsy twins have a piece of my mind."
    C "Y-You—!"
    "But just as I am about to let loose on the two girls beside me I find that they're no longer clinging to me at all, which actually makes sense in how easily I was able to retrieve the key."
    "My eyes follow the trail in the thin snow cover to find the pair strolling toward the academy like they weren't just a second ago groping me all over in the middle of the road up to the school."
    H "{i}Le abbiamo sicuramente piegato gli spaghetti.{/i}" # we definitely bent her spaghetti

    "I'm half confused and half {b}fuming{/b}. I can feel the heat swelling in my cheeks and in my chest, made visible from which extra puffy breaths of air which emerge from my lungs."
    "My whole body is warm now that I'm so worked up, banishing for the moment the heavy chill of the winter."
    C "(What the hell was all that!?)"
    "The two girls are not super far away and I could chase them down if abandon my duffel and all my things here, but I don't know exactly what I'd do when I reach them."
    "What I do know is that the warmth I felt while they were close is rapidly being eaten away by the cold sting of the biting winter breeze."

    "As I trudge deeper into the campus I find girls in similar uniforms hurry past me toward the living quarters as expected given the hour of the day, and so I follow them."
    "I don't try to talk to a single one of my new fellow students. I'm still reeling from my first meeting with the strange enrollees from this academy and don't want to invite another incident."
    C "(She stuck her hand... {b}all{/b} the way up there!)"

    "When the door opens I find another girl atop one of a pair of beds before me. An apology tumbles out instinctively."
    C "S-Sorry, I—"
    "I catch the words of my reflexive apology quickly, finding the girl roused neither by the door opening or my apology, merely lying still on the bed."
    "The presence of two beds inside the room stokes my worst fears, which are confirmed when I double check my key card and the room number outside the door."
    C "(So this is a \"roommate\" type of boarding school. Not fancy enough to give everyone their own rooms, huh?)"
    "It's certainly going to be an adjustment from being an only child and having my own room. One of many adjustments in my life that I'm suddenly being forced to make."
    C "(If I keep my space from her it shouldn't be a problem.)"
    "The rare optimistic thought passes through my mind as I try to close the door behind me, however it does not comfort me in the slightest."
    "Even as I think I should stay as far away as humanely possible, something tickles at my curiosity deep inside which forces me to draw closer to the sleeping figure."
    "Having already been surprised by the pair of girls from before, I approach my new roommate cautiously, ready for anything, but still she remains unstirred."
    C "(She's not... {b}dead{/b}, right?)"
    "Looking more closely, I find her chest rise and fall with calm breathing. I quickly surmise through the inspection that she likely unintentionally fell asleep and is otherwise perfectly alive and healthy."
    "Lying in full uniform crossways atop her bed, she rests in the classic pose one makes when she rests her head for \"just a moment\" and suddenly loses precious hours of the day."
    "It's kind of cute in a way, like a child who plays too hard and tuckers herself right out."
    "It's only recently that I've been trying to embrace my \"cute\" side, but so far have totally failed trying compete with girls like this who are naturals to it."
    "What's more, her figure is slim and beautiful in a way that I have never been able to accomplish for myself and which sparks intense envy in my chest."
    C "(Why does dieting only make my face break out and look nasty? What am I doing wrong that she is doing right?)"
    "A long, thin paper banner is strung across her torso, draped loosely between the slim fingers of the sleeping figure where she once held it."
    "\"Welcome Clover!\" the banner reads in sparkling glitter lettering, and I come to realize that she too must have gotten caught up in my late arrival."
    "It's even decorated with all sorts of cute little drawings, including tons of shamrocks."
    C "(Because of my name, of course.)"
    "I've lost count by now of how many people over my lifetime have picked a clover out of the grass and pointed between it and me with a grin."
    "I momentarily feel guilty that I might have suspected her of something terrible when she so clearly put effort into welcoming me into what was previously only her space."
    "The girl herself is sleeping soundly, lying with her head turned aside away my the edge of the bed, but by leaning in further I can see her features more clearly."
    C "(Her eyelashes are so long...)"
    "Long auburn curls stream from her head, which makes me again flame with envy as someone who has lived with straight hair her entire life."
    "A strange thought passed through my mind that this almost feels like a scene out of a fairy tale, where the prince wakes the princess with a kiss."
    C "(Like hell I'm kissing a stranger though. Gross. Why are old fairy tales so creepy?)"
    "Little flickers of a dream in progress play cross her sleeping features and make her pale pink lips tremble. It's captivating in a strange way that draws me in even closer."
    #TODO insert bed creak sound here
    "The sudden creak of the bed when I shift more weight against it draws me sharply out of the trance. Pulling myself quickly away the bed, I turn around again toward my own."
    C "(What am I {b}doing{/b}?)"
    "My mind lingers on the mental images of my roommate's sleeping face longer than I would like. My chest thumps loudly in my ears while I heft my luggage onto the bed as distraction."
    C "(It's been a long day. I'm tired.)"
    "The explanation fits neatly in my mind and I think nothing more of it, instead turning to empty out my stuffed duffel before I hit the hay myself."
    rm "...Clover?"
    "The words float out airily behind me, soft enough for them to tickle at my ears and force their way between all the dark thoughts brewing in my mind."
    "Once they worm deep enough into the my brain, I whip back around quickly toward my suddenly very awake roommate propped up on one arm."
    "More awake than before, anyway. Her long lashes lay heavy over her crisp blue eyes and the soft pout from being pulled out of a dream too early remains on her lips."
    C "What do you want?"
    "I just sort of... blurt the words out while my brain is still working to catch up and immediately realize how rude that must sound."
    "Before I can say anything more, I'm caught speechless when she tosses her loosely bound auburn curls with the back of her hand. She winces, her eyes cast downward."
    rm "A better introduction than {b}this{/b}. How careless of me to have fallen asleep."
    "I can feel heart skips a beat as I watch her quickly lean across to check her alarm clock on the nightstand, then flash her big round eyes back at me."
    "Struggling to find the right balance of apologizing for being awful and keeping my distance, I brush a hand through my own fair tresses in a show of innocuous detachment."
    C "I was just surprised to hear you. I'm super late, sore from lugging my bag all the way here, and two crazy girls groped me on the way here."
    "Why I care enough about her feelings to not just dismiss her outright I do not know, but I rationalize that it's better to be on her good side than her bad."
    rm "I'm so sorry, I meant to be there when you arrived to help you and— oh, my name is Sibyl. Sibyl Hyltebruk."

    C "Umm... happy to meet you, Sibyl. So we're going to be roommates, huh?"
    "It's merely a polite greeting and a rhetorical question, so I turn about to begun unpacking before I get any more caught up in her pitiful, sleepy expressions."
    "From behind, Sibyl yawns into a reply with no intention to let the conversation drop there. It's clear her sleepiness is rapidly fading away for better or worse."

            "My tone comes out pretty dark, and Sibyl apparently chooses not to pry into it any further."
    "Correctly surmising that I had discarded the dull school literature at first glance, she launches into her own explanation."
    S "Vertu partners are like... having a best friend or an older sister to help you, and to be that person for your partner as well."
    S "More than simply sharing this room, we are meant to share our triumphs with each other, and split the burden of our tribulations."
    "Her explanation increasingly sounds like she's quoting directly from the pamphlet."
    C "That's pretty poetic sounding, huh?"
    "Honestly, I couldn't care less about any of that flowery language and it probably shows in the flat tone of voice which my reply sounds out with."

    C "No."
    "The momentary silence which follows is comfortable to me, but seemingly not to Sibyl."
    S "You're my first Vertu partner, you know that? By chance our grade level was uneven and I was the odd one out in our year who received no Vertu."
    C "(And there she goes again.)"
    "She keeps saying \"Vertu\" with a strangely serious tone like it is some hallowed institution akin to marriage."
    C "(Like I'd ever marry another girl in the first place...)"
    "Just thinking about two girls together \"like tha\" brings the pair from earlier to mind. I can already feel the heat of my blood boiling just thinking about."

    S "Clover, are you alright?"
    C "Y-Yeah, I'm fine."
    "Clover catches me momentarily zoning out back into recent events, and makes it known that she's still in the room with me."
    S "Maybe I didn't make a good first impression on account of dozing off, but I really would like to help you."
    C "I don't need help."
    S "I'm your Vertu partner, Clover, and this is what Vertu partners do."
    C "Thank you, Sibyl, but I'm very {b}self-sufficient{/b}."
    "The room goes quiet between us as soon as I say the words with a cold tone of annoyance rising clearly in my voice."
    "I continue folding the clothes taken out of my luggage while turned away from Sibyl behind me. An apology is considered, but I decide against it."
    C "(That's honestly how I feel, and if she doesn't like it, it's better that she doesn't get too attached to me anyway.)"

    C "Sibyl—"
    "With a short sigh I turn around to face Sibyl and am surprised that I don't find her in tears, or even with a frown on her face."
    "Instead, I find an expression of utmost concern on her features, like my cold demeanor is her fault and not entirely my stubbornness."
    C "Sibyl, I'm sorry, you've been super nice and everything, really, and I didn't mean to shut you down like that."
    C "I've just been going through some personal things, and I need some space right now, okay?"
    "She smiles up hopefully to me from where she sits on her bed, her blue eyes meeting my own and lingering in the connected gaze."
    "I tear my gaze away from her puppy dog stare, and swallowing my pride somewhat, ultimately throw her a bone."
    C "But I will be counting on you to show me around campus and classes, and stuff like where to find the cafeteria and all that."
    C "(Wat's wrong with me? When did I becomes such a pushover?)"
    S "Oh no, the cafeteria!"
    "The sudden change in mood startles me by the suddenness of it all. There's a serious look plastered on Sibyl's face that can't be good."
    C "W-What wrong with it?"

    C "For how long!?"
    S "Until tomorrow morning."
    "Relief washes over me, having thought for a moment there that I'd be starving due to a permanently closed cafeteria in addition to everything else terrible here."

    C "Well... kinda..."

    S "I'm afraid not... but, ah, let's go speak to Miss Woolsey, she will be able to help us."

    S "You were a student here, Miss Woolsey?"
    mw "More than just a mere student, I was the Student Council president!"

    mw "If you don't mind me asking, Clover, why did you choose to attend Prudence Prep?"
    "Miss Woolsey, while friendly, is being awfully persistent at trying to get me to open up when I have no intention of doing so, and the annoyance leads me to say more than I wanted to aloud."

    "It's the teacher's job to look after me just as much as it is apparently Sibyl's responsibility to be my \"Vertu\"."

    "She's just trying to console me, I know, but she stepped right on the land mine already primed to explode."
    C "I already {b}have{/b} a family, I don't need a second one!"
    "The long and arduous journey here, the muddled rush of emotions in the past few minutes, and everything else swirling together in my skull draws yet another verbal jab which I cannot take back."
    "It's shockingly ineffective on Sibyl, who only follows my angry outburst with a look of pity and understanding."
    S "Oh, Clover..."
    "It's unnerving, to see this strange reaction to me being so cold to her. Sibyl's soothing smile and big, sparkling eyes peering out at me makes my stomach flop and flutter."
    C "(What could she possibly be thinking now? She doesn't know a single thing about me!)"
    "Sibyl might have the expression of utmost compassion and understanding on her face but my athletics teacher is only further troubled by everything that's happening."
    C "(I'm sure she's thinking she's only made things worse with her persistent questioning.)"

    C "...Thanks."

    "For a moment I think I see Tanya flick a glance my way as they leave me at the table, but it might just be my imagination."
    "Sibyl and Tanya are obviously close already, even after just a few months together. The pair walk quite close side-by-side all the way up to the kitchens."
    "Tanya in particular doesn't seem at all hesitant to softly lean on Sibyl's arm as they laugh about something to one another, and Sibyl appears quite happy to accept the intimate friendship."

    "With Tanya still deep into her breakfast it's mostly Sibyl who keeps engaging me in conversation, though at my next question Tanya does huff angrily into her yogurt parfait."
    C "Uh huh. And who's Sierra."
    S "Tanya's Vertu partner. You might say that they don't exactly get along super well together."

    C "Do you want it back? Maybe there's an extra room I can camp out in."
    "Sibyl seemingly ignores my interjection and continues on without acknowledging my interruption at all."

    S "Every night, I sat in my lonesome room with my only company being the empty bed across the way."
    C "That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?"

    C "But you have Tanya now, right? So you don't need me."
    S "Tanya is a wonderful friend, that much is true, but she is not my Vertu partner."
    C "Well Tanya hates her own Vertu, so why can't you just switch?"
    T "I would {b}love{/b} to foist Sierra off onto you, but one cannot just {b}switch{/b} a Vertu partner."
    "Both of them look almost shocked, like this is the most absurd thing they've ever heard and not at all a totally rational idea."
    C "Okay, okay, I get it. No switching Vertus. It's a sacred bond between two girls that can never be broken."
    "Sibyl smiles at my sarcastic reply even though it should be clear from my tone that it is indeed incredibly sarcastic."
    C "(I suppose she just likes hearing me say it like that will make me believe it eventually too.)"

    "I've only been here less than twenty-four hours and yet I've already been both sexually assaulted and then humiliated in front of the whole class."
    "All of that just feels like extra bitter icing on the terrible cake of my life in recent weeks. My whole life really started unraveling before I even got here."

    C "You're all running away from me? Fine, I came here to be alone anyway."

    C "(Confined to campus, making me speak in front of everyone, loading me all up with homework... Ugh!)"
    "I quickly came to learn just how seriously the teachers here take academics. The amount of homework I have already been assigned seems overkill for just half a day of lessons."
    "Desperately, I tell myself that the class was only assigned so much because they want students to refresh what they learned before break, and that it will give me time to catch up."
    C "(Wishful thinking. Ugh.)"

    "There's a light swell in my chest which surprises even me as I look expectantly toward the doorway but it's not luxurious brown curls which I see flutter through the doorway."
    "Rather, it's straight black locks shining like a negative of my own fair-toned strands."
    T "So this is where you ran off to."
    "Deep down I know it was foolish to have assumed I would know some random person entering the room, let alone that it would be my roommate. That it's someone I've met is miraculous enough."
    C "Y-Yeah. I just needed some time alone."
    "Knowing that my expression must be quite dark, I turn my head aside away from Tanya back toward the fish swimming in the tanks."

    T "That's what Sibyl thought."
    C "She knows me so well."

    C "(Curfew? Is it that late already? Wait, I have a curfew!?)"
    "I distinctly recall Sibyl saying something about that, but like many things it fell silently on deaf ears."
    C "...Why didn't Sibyl come for me?"
    T "Huh?"
    "The question must have caught her off guard because she's momentarily quieted by the question. I'm a little surprised at it myself even though it came from my own lips."
    C "She's the one always saying that we're partners and we're supposed to support each other. Why didn't she come looking for me?"
    T "We {b}both{/b} went looking for you, Clover, and a couple others besides. It's a big school."
    "I glance back blankly at Tanya. She sighs with dismay and shakes her head side to side, then tosses a hand to rest at her hip to reset."
    T "Hey, are you feeling alright, Clover?"
    "The soft tone of concern about a girl she barely knows kind of annoys me and I cannot stop myself from letting it come out through my words again."
    C "What does it matter to you anyway? Don't you have your own \"Virtue\" to worry about?"
    "Tanya's tone again turns, this time more firmly, which is really no surprise with how obstinate I'm being toward her."
    T "{b}Vertu{/b}. It's a French word, {b}Vertu{/b}, and it is a foundational aspect of this academy."
    "Tanya corrects me with a measure of her fading patience clear in her voice, but some of the concern also remains as she continues right on pestering me."
    T "It matters to me because it matters to Sibyl. You're all she's talked about {b}all day{/b}. She's barely said a word to me today that wasn't about {b}you{/b}!"
    T "So please, just come on and let's hurry back before the bell rings for curfew."

    C "Don't touch me!"
    T "Augh!"
    "I'm actually a little surprised by the strong huff of frustration that comes from Tanya after how understanding she was being just a moment before."
    "My cantankerous behavior has clearly ticked her off. Her hair is ever so slightly amiss from my shove, however light it was, and her cheeks flush a faint pink from her apparent consternation."
    T "Don't you know how hard Sibyl is trying to help you? Could you please at least {b}try{/b} to not fight her the whole way?"
    #C "Well I didn't {b}ask{/b} for her to do anything for me."
    #T "She does it because you're her Vertu partner and, more than that, because it's the right thing to do."
    #T "I don't know what she thinks she sees in you, but something has convinced her that she knows exactly what sort of help you need."
    C "I don't {b}need{/b} any {b}help{/b}."
    "My defiant snap only makes Tanya groan with frustration."
    T "That's exactly what she said you would say. You're infuriating, you know that?"
    T "Maybe {b}Sibyl{/b} isn't pissed off, but {b}I{/b} sure am! And the worst part is that I've only known you for a single day!"
    T "You should count yourself fortunate that Sibyl has such patience and compassion to put up with your moody bullshit."
    "Amidst her tirade, Tanya steps closer, nearly backing me into a fish tank. She's not much larger than I am but somehow she feels so much more dangerous in the moment."
    T "You {b}do{/b} need help. There's {b}clearly{/b} something {b}wrong{/b} with you."
    T "Every time someone tries to help you or say single thing nice to you, you have to spit it back in their faces!"
    T "You don't {b}deserve{/b} to have someone so special as a Vertu partner, you know that?"
    T "If you aren't going to respect Sibyl, then {b}stay away{/b} from her, got that!?"
    "Tanya's rant doesn't scare me. I've had worse language thrown in my face before and half of that stupid rant was just praising Sibyl anyway."
    "As my reprisal, I hiss a childish \"if you love her so much, why don't you marry her\" which succeeds beautifully in getting under little-miss-best-friend's skin."
    "Tanya nearly looks like she's about to claw my face off but instead shoves me back against the fish tank to turn away and stomp out of the aquarium."
    "With the irate presence before me suddenly gone, I slump down right there with my back against the cold, hard glass."
    C "(She was the one getting all up in my business. She was asking for that.)"
    "The irritable mood brought on by Tanya's presence gradually fades back into the creeping darkness, and consequently my brain play right back everything that just happened."
    "In one second my mood shifts such that I feel like I deserved all that abuse, and in the next my mood shifts again such that I'm certain Tanya is a fake and pushy bitch."

    C "Why do you care so much about me? You don't even {b}know{/b} me."

    S "Oh, and before I forget, your phone was ringing like crazy earlier."
    "The heat which had slowly been returning to body all of a sudden dissipates into thin air."

    C "(Like she cares a single bit about me at all anymore.)"
    "It's from my mom. She's asking about my first day at school like it wasn't partly her fault for abandon me here in the first place."
    "Or like she and Dad aren't tearing our family apart and destroy our lives together, the life I've always known and loved up until just recently."
    "I chuck the smartphone into my pillow at full force, clearly alarming Sibyl across the room."

    "Most confirm my own suspicions that they are far too engaged with their friends to notice me, but after passing a few more doors down the hallway a pair of students do look my way in passing."
    C "(I think they are in my homeroom.)"
    "My introduction was a spectacular failure so I had written off ever speaking to anyone from then on, but despite my fears the pair only looked curious about me when they looked my way."
    "I whip my head around after the first pair to semi-discreetly look their way in the hallway and find them whispering to themselves when they pass."
    C "(Can I pull off \"cool\"? Probably not. \"Mysterious\"? Maybe. \"Beautiful\"? Sounds like a lot of work.)"
    "Some part of me refuses to accept those two classmates were merely curious about me and that they must have instead been secretly mocking me."
    "I would believe anything if it means not having to admit that Vittoria and Vincenza may have been right about some things."
    #C "(Because if they were correct about this, what else have I been wrong about?)"
    "I anxiously glance at every passing girl in the hallways while heading back to my dorm room, all the while telling myself I can't possibly be mistaken for what I am feeling so strongly."

    "It's a relief when I finally get back to my room, far away from any invasively curious or potentially judgemental eyes."
    "To my surprise, a small cardboard box sits atop my desk. I slump my school bag onto the chair and peer over at it like it might explode, or worse."
    C "(\"Clover Ipswich\". It's for me. From...)"
    "A heavy blanket of chill drapes over my shoulders as I read the familiar address of the sender."
    "A strange mixture of excitement and dread fill my stomach, like it's full of butterflies on fire madly flapping their wings."
    "I step over to my bed and flop onto it in a daze, but ultimately my body is hypnotically drawn back to the box on the desk."
    C "(Do they need me to sign some papers for their divorce? Is this the sum of my inheritance after being entirely written out of their lives? Am I being sent to live with a foster family?)"
    "Many terrible thoughts pass through my head, each one more awful than the last as I apprehensively trace the sharp edge of a pair of scissors around the tape holding the flaps closed."
    "I sit cross-legged on the bed with the package before me, then with a deep breath to expel my hesitation finally flip the cardboard flaps open."
    "What greets me is a familiar goofy face which draws an equally goofy expression of my own."
    C "Abraxas!"
    "Right on top is a whole bundle of the picture frames I used to keep on my desk. Topmost among them is my photo of my furry best friend from when he was still a puppy."
    "The other frames behind it I also recognize but leave covered while I set the photos aside to eagerly dig through the rest of the box."
    C "(It's a whole care package!)"
    "Beneath those surprises lie yet more wonders — a veritable treasure trove of my favorite things, from my choice in candy bars to a full set of sparkly glitter gel pens."
    "The last thing I pull out of the box I can smell before I even see what's wrapped in the plastic container."
    C "(It can't be...)"
    "But as I unwrap it, yes, it is."
    C "Mom's famous peanut brittle! I don't believe it!"
    "I say it out loud to my empty room, it's that unbelievable. This particular treat is something she only makes around Thanksgiving."
    C "(She must have made it special for me.)"
    "I unwrap a little piece eagerly and take a nibble out of it. The nostalgic tastes spreads across my tongue instantly, transporting me back home if only for a moment."
    "The second nibble is saltier, and more wet than the first. By the time I finish the little piece, the tears splash unceasingly onto my lap."
    "The colors of my room begin to smear and blend together, but a brush of the back of my hand against my eyes brings focus finally to the folded letter waiting at the bottom of the box."
    "A new-found warmth fills my stomach, more than the little piece of peanut brittle ever could, dousing the fires of anger and fear enough for me to read the note."
    "I fight back my tears through every word full of love and encouragement to make new friends at the academy."
    C "(Mom... Dad...)"
    "I've always known deep down that my parents still love me, but seeing it written after unwrapping all the thoughtful makes the weight of their love rest heavily in my chest."
    "They mention nothing about the divorce that I know is still looming like the blade of a guillotine over everything."
    "The letter merely contains the same love and comfort I've always known, and which I've been terribly missing since I left home."
    "I begin re-reading again from the top, the tears picking up in volume out of my eyes as I read the words written in familiar script."
    "I'm only through the first paragraph by the time my rampaging emotions overflow. I stuff my face into the pillow to muffle the wails of my bawling."

    "A soft clatter across the room finally stirs me from my pillow. With a sniffle to contain my ugly runny nose, I glance up at it."
    "Sibyl stands at the door, leaning back against it, her face politely turned away from staring at me. There are tiny paint fleck across her nose and cheeks, no doubt evidence of her club activities."
    C "S-Sibyl..."
    S "Would you like to be alone, Clover?"
    "My gaze turns down toward the ground as I judge the state of my being. I find it poor but with the strength of an intense cathartic release buoying my head above water."
    C "No..."
    "Even so, my voice comes out shaky and quiet. I'm trembling all over, but I feel neither sad nor angry."
    "I pick up the letter again, read a few lines written there, and somehow find my head clearer than it's been in recent memory."
    "\"Keep your head up and your heart open. Good things are sure to follow.\""
    "I do what Dad asks, raising my head to regard Sibyl across the room."
    C "No. I'm... going to be alright. You can stay."
    "With an understanding smile I've come expect from her, Sibyl sets down her bag and moves to sit on my bed across from me at a comfortable distance."
    S "Whatcha got here?"
    "I can sense a little tentativeness in her actions like she doesn't want to spook me, and I find it more silly than annoying how careful she's being around me for the first time."
    C "A care package."
    S "From your parents?"
    "I offer a little nod instead of vocalizing and Sibyl responds with a pleasant \"How lovely!\" which rings just as sweetly in my ears as the peanut brittle did in my mouth."
    S "Would you like to show me?"
    "I distinctly feel as though she's treating me like a little kid but presently allow with consideration toward my delicate emotional state."
    C "It's a whole bunch of my favorite things."
    "Digging into the peanut brittle, I offer her a piece which she gladly accepts."
    S "It's delicious!"
    "She probably has no idea how much this peanut brittle means to me, but she also probably deserves a little bit for having put up with me the past few days."
    "That's right, I am all but forced to admit that {b}maybe{/b} Sibyl was right about her \"storm clouds\", and that I have been a touch dramatic."
    "All it takes in the end is this thoughtful reminder that I'm not out of my parents' hearts forever just because they suddenly sent me away."
    "None of this excuses what they've put me through so far, but I'm unable to feel as hurt after seeing all this as I was when they first kicked me out of our home to send me here."
    "Turning again to the photos, I pluck the photo of my beloved pet off the top of the stack to push toward her."
    C "And some of my photo frames too. It feels like I haven't seen Abraxas in months, but I know it's only been a week or two."
    S "What's a \"braxas\"?"
    "I'm confused for a moment - an expression similarly shared by Sibyl - until what she asked finally gets through my head and I burst out into a modest fit of laughter."
    S "D-Don't laugh at me! I don't know everything!"
    C "Abraxas is my dog. That's his name."
    "It's only when I push the photo of Abraxas more firmly into her face that she finally understands."
    S "Cute! How ever did you come up with that name?"
    "My gaze shifts away from Sibyl's face as I feel the surge of warmth I know to be embarrassment rush to color my cheeks."
    C "(Head up. Heart open.)"
    "In the tiniest quiet voice I tell Sibyl all, no matter how embarrassing it is to say it."
    C "It's a word of mystic meaning in the system of the Gnostic Basilides applied to the {i}megas archōn{/i}, {i}princeps{/i} of the three hundred sixty five {i}ouranoi{/i}."
    "I wince after finishing the recitation, expecting raucous laughter out of Sibyl, but to my surprise she's merely curious about all the strange things I've just said aloud."
    S "Wow, I have no idea what any of that means but it's quite a mouthful. Where did you learn all that?"
    "The shame of the question weighs on me again. With sweat beginning to gather on my forehead, I draw my blonde hair across my face to hide in my traditional fashion."
    C "I was pretty deep into an occult goth phase in middle school."
    S "That explains this photo!"
    C "(Wait, what?)"
    "I toss my hair away quickly to confirm what I most feared. In picking up the photo of Abraxas, I exposed the one underneath to view."
    S "Wow..."
    C "(Oh no, here comes the mockery. I'll never be able to meet Sibyl's gaze again!)"
    S "How {b}did{/b} you get all that dye out of your hair?"
    C "H-Huh?"
    "Sibyl holds up the photo of me and my three friends decked out in the most embarrassing, all-black outfits we could possibly muster, each of us with pitch black hair."
    C "O-Oh, well... I've been trying to grow it out naturally but my hair is actually bleached and dyed from about here down."
    "Sibyl reaches out unbidden to twirl my hair through her fingers and tease the ends. I know she's looking for any telltale breakage."
    S "Really? It's still so strong and smooth, and I can barely tell it's dyed."
    "It's even more unbearably embarrassing than I could possibly have expected it to be but actually feels really nice to have her play it with too."
    C "I'm pretty good with hair dye. Lots of experience..."
    C "(This is {b}not{/b} how I wanted to \"open my heart\", Dad!)"
    C "You don't think I'm weird, Sibyl? For being into all this insane goth stuff?"
    "Sibyl laughs shortly at my question, not with malice, but apparently at how absurd it is — and probably also at whatever pitiful expression I have on my face."
    S "Of course not, Clover. We've all done goofy things, haven't we?"
    "A soft flush emerges on Sibyl's cheeks despite her apparent reluctance to elaborate what she is clearly remembering to herself."
    S "Besides, you shouldn't be afraid to show who you are. You might meet people who share the same interests if you're more open about yourself and your interests."
    C "I understand what you're saying Sibyl, okay? But you have to {b}promise{/b} me you won't tell {b}anyone{/b} about this. I put all this stuff behind me for good when I started high school."
    "It's clear that Sibyl doesn't agree with my request but honors it anyway and motions once more to the photo."
    S "Are these your friends?"
    C "From middle school."
    S "Not anymore?"
    "The way I toss the photo aside should provide enough of an answer, but if I've already said this much a little more won't kill me."
    C "Not anymore. When high school started and we all quit the goth stuff, we kind of went separate ways."
    "Two of my friends got boyfriends, the third made softball her {b}entire{/b} life, and I just stayed... me."
    S "I'm sorry to hear that, Clover. You four of you look like you had a lot of fun together."
    "A quiver of a sob threatens to burst up through my chest but ultimately dies there before being born into the world."
    "It's fully a surprise because I've long since written off all three of them from my life ever since we went our separate ways, but nostalgia, it seems, almost gets the best of me this time."
    C "We did. Honestly, it was... kind of hard, starting high school like that, with no friends, and no place to belong. And even when I got home, things were still kinda rough..."
    C "(Oh God, what am I {b}saying{/b}? I didn't mean to \"open my heart\" {b}this{/b} much! Make it stop!)"
    S "That's one of the reasons I wanted to come to Prudence Prep. The Vertu system ensures we're never alone and always have a supportive environment around us."
    "It might not have been a big thing to Sibyl, but what she says leaves me dazed. All at once I realize what I fool I've been."
    C "(Of course... I'm such an idiot.)"
    "Not hearing me reply, Sibyl stops to look back at me in concern, whispering my name with uncertainty."
    S "Clover...?"
    C "(Mom, Dad, I'm so sorry.)"
    "For weeks I've felt that being sent here to the academy must be some kind of punishment or just plain abandonment. Now I finally come to realize that they did this all for me."
    C "(Being sent here was for {b}my{/b} benefit.)"
    "My parents surely miss me just as much as I miss them, but between my troubles fitting in at school and the complex home life with their divorce..."
    C "(They just wanted me to be happy. That's all they've ever wanted for me.)"
    "Tears start rolling down my cheeks thicker than a monsoon. Sibyl worriedly calls out my name again so I reach out to touch her arm and calm her concern."
    C "I'm sorry, I just... need a moment to process some things, like, in my head."
    S "Of course, Clover. Take all the time you need."
