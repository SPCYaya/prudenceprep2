    "A warm breath puffs up through my chest and escapes between my chapped lips, a soft wisp born into the frigid late January air."
    "Another particularly heavy huff flutters through the the straight cut bangs of my flaxen blonde hair, sending little white flakes fluttering down before me."
    C "And now it's snowing too. Wonderful."
    "I stop to ruffle my heavy back and forth, casting off all the snow which had started to accumulate atop my head."
    "Then, with a frown solidly plastered on my face, I hump the duffel strap more securely over my shoulder and continue down the long wooded lane."
    C "(\"When we were your age, we walked to school up hill both ways in the snow!\")"
    "I can almost {b}hear{/b} the voice of my grandparents in my mind as I trudge along slowly toward my new school."
    "I'm already dressed in my new uniform, a very girly pink and white outfit which is totally unlike what I used to wear at my old school, even after I dumped my old wardrobe."
    "As much as I dread finally reaching the end of this lane, the cute uniform is secretly the one thing I actually kind of like — with one exception."
    "Whether the size is wrong for my scrawny body or because I'm undertaking this long trek while lugging nearly my entire worldly belongings, the warm white tights just are {b}not{/b} cooperating."
    C "(Drooping here, bunching there...)"
    "I perform an inelegant half jig for a few steps, trying to correct the tights around my legs as I walk."
    "A wave of relief washes over me when I sight the stately buildings of Prudence Preparatory Academy and the prominent statue of the Virgin Mary a little further down the way."
    "Not because I'm excited to get to school, of course, but merely because it means I'm almost done with this stupid walk."
    "Turning about to face the empty lane in the way I had just come with the building to my back, I stop where I stand to fix my tights."
    "My fingers dig under my skirt to pinch and dig at the tight fabric which runs up to my waist, hoping it sort it out with finality before I arrive."
    g1 "Dear me, Vincenza, and the in the sight of the Virgin Mary too."
    g2 "Oh, Vittoria, you know that the Virgin Mary always watches over us."
    "Unexpectedly from behind floats a pair of voices and a titter of laughter against the quiet of the evening dust of snowfall."
    "Before my mind can process it any further, a sudden weight presses around the back of my neck and upon my shoulders."
    O "The proper young ladies of the academy do such things in the confines of their own rooms."
    "The second girl's voice is close, close enough for me to feel the warmth of her breath on the left side of my face."
    "Flipping my head suddenly to the side, I catch sight of the face of the girl in question. She wears a soft grin upon a graceful pale face, set below sharp but cheerful eyes."
    "From her head falls a stream of fine silver hair across her face, styled with a neat, boyish look that oddly doesn't contrast at all with the uniform."
    H "Maybe she isn't a proper young lady at all?"
    "A soft touch against the small of my back announces the arrival of the first girl, and it remains as she swoops close across my other side in a flutter of voluminous silvery curls toward my front."
    "When my head flips back the other way, I find that this girl shares similar features to the first, albeit a very different, much more feminine aura."
    "The first thought through my brain is that they must be twins, with a foreign accent common between them adding to the similarity."
    C "(What... the hell is happening?)"
    "The latter girl draws close to my face, reaching a hand toward my chin to guide my head this way and that in momentary inspection."
    H "A young lady, for sure, but the question of her {b}propriety{/b} remains."
    C "(Who {b}are{/b} these girls?)"
    "So goes my second thought. Frozen in place with confusion and uncertainty, the pair continue on their back and forth with barely an acknowledgement of me besides their hands {b}all over{/b} my body."
    O "You've kept us waiting, Clover. We have a very important meeting to attend."
    "With her right arm still heavy around my shoulders, her left heedlessly picks at the leftmost strap of my jumper skirt, following it slowly all the way up my chest."
    C "...My bus was late. H-Hey, what are you—!"
    "I might have totally forgotten that I had my skirt hiked up to pick at my tights when I was suddenly beset upon, but the girl on my right certainly hasn't."
    "The hand of hers which isn't on my small of my back drops from my chin and brushes against the hand I was using to fix my tights, only to go further still, picking up where I had left off."
    H "Oh my, and with your uniform so disarrayed. Please allow me to assist. You want to make a good first impression for your Vertu, is that right?"
    "She pulls at the tights bunching around my knees and slides the palm of her hand up my leg with it, smoothing the thin material across my thighs."
    "My body tingles with the smoothness of her touch, however stiff I am with the shock and confusion of someone acting so out of ordinary convention."
    O "The poor little thing's frozen solid. Can we not keep her just a little longer, Vittoria?"
    "The strap of my jumper is released from the second girl's fingers, but rather than remove them, she goes yet further to lay her hand across my chest."
    C "S-Stop, I can—"
    "Her fingers tease their tips slowly between the buttons of my blouse, catching just slightly on each as she trails her way up to straighten the pink necktie at the very top."
    "To say I'm flustered is an understatement. I'm not usually one who likes handsy people, and this is going way beyond handsy."
    H "We were only asked to deliver her room key, Vincenza, and we are late ourselves as you rightly pointed out."
    "The first girl's palm glides well higher than it has any right to up the inside of my thigh, flattening out with the tights out around my hip."
    O "Pity..."
    "Distracted and slowed from logical thought by the strange caresses all over my body, it's only then that I come to the heart of the matter."
    C "W-Wait, room key?"
    "With a soft giggle, the first girl's fingers clip against my stomach where the white tights meet their end, followed by the hard, cold touch of something entirely inhuman against my bare skin."
    C "H-Hyah!"
    "I quiver instinctively against the cold metal wedged between my skin and my tights and break the stupor the mysterious pair of girls had put me in."
    "The heavy duffel strap still slung over my shoulder finally drops off as I shake about trying to fish out the object from inside my tights."
    "I hold the offending item up before my face as I do, finding a plastic id card with my face on it staring back, a metal carabiner attached to it."
    C "Y-You—!"
    "For a moment I am about to let loose on the two girls beside me, only to find that they're no longer clinging to me at all, which makes sense in how easily I was able to retrieve the key."
    "Whipping around, I find them already strolling arm-in-arm back toward the academy."
    H "Le abbiamo sicuramente piegato gli spaghetti." # we definitely bent her spaghetti
    O "Certamente." # for sure
    "Now that my brain has caught up, I'm half confused and half {b}fuming{/b}. I can feel the heat rising in my cheeks, and the extra puffy breaths of air emerging from my lungs."
    "But rather than chase after them, now a fair distance away, I resign myself to heaving my duffel back over my shoulder and finally read the keycard in my hand."

    "Most look at me curiously, some call out a welcome, and others still try to engage me in friendly conversation."

    "It's certainly an adjustment from being an only child and having my own room, but if I keep my space from her it shouldn't be a problem,{b}hopefully{/b}."

    C "(Just what is she up to...?)"
    "I quickly surmise that she unintentionally fell asleep, lying in uniform crossways atop her bed, in the classic pose one makes when she rests her head for \"just a moment\"."
    "A long, thin paper banner is strung across her, draped loosely between the slim pale fingers of the sleeping figure where she once held it."
    "\"Welcome Clover!\" the banner reads in sparkling glitter lettering, and I realize that she too must have gotten caught up in my late arrival."
    "It's even decorated with all sorts of cute little drawings, and tons of shamrocks."
    C "(Because of my name, of course.)"
    "I've lost count of how many people have picked a clover out of the grass and pointed between it and me with a giggle."
    "For just a second while reading the banner, I feel guilty that I might have suspected her of something terrible, but that feeling quickly passes."
    "The girl herself is sleeping soundly, lying with her head turned aside away my the edge of the bed, but by leaning in further I can see her features clearly."
    C "(Her eyelashes are so long...)"
    "I look twice, just to be sure she isn't wearing mascara, but I detect no trace of it at all."
    "That she's gorgeous is plainly evident. Long chestnut curls stream from her head down her back and side, of which I am most jealous, but it doesn't stop there."
    "Her cheeks are smooth and fair, with high cheek bones and large eyes that complete her charming profile."
    "Further below, her pale pink lips part ever so slightly with the little flickers of a dream in progress playing cross her sleeping features."
    #TODO insert bed creak here

    C "(W-What am I {b}doing{/b}?)"
    "Pulling myself quickly away the bed, I turn around again toward my own, but my thoughts are still elsewhere."
    "My mind lingers on the mental images of my roommate's sleeping face longer than I would like, and my chest pounds in my ears as they begin to dissipate from mental view."

    rm "Clover?"
    "The words float out airily behind me, soft enough for them to tickle at my ears while my brain steams within my skull."
    "Once it worms its way into the front of my brain, I whip back around just as quickly toward my suddenly very awake roommate and propped up on one arm."
    "More awake than before, anyway. Her long lashes lay heavy over her crisp blue eyes, and a soft pout from being pulled out of her dream remains on her lips."
    C "What do you want?"
    "I just sort of... blurt it out while my brain is still churning, and immediately realize how rude that must sound."
    "Before I can say anything more, I'm caught speechless when she unexpectedly winces with her eyes cast downward and tosses her brunette curls with the back of her hand."
    rm "A better introduction than {b}this{/b}. How silly of me to have fallen asleep..."
    "My heart skips a beat as I watch her suffer my rude greeting after having gone to such lengths to welcome me into the room she lives in."
    "Struggling to find the right balance of apologizing and keeping my distance, I brush a hand through my own fair tresses in a show of casual detachment."
    C "Sorry, I was just surprised to hear you, and I'm super late, and sore from lugging my bag all the way here, and the two crazy girls touched me all over, and..."
    "I surprise even myself by beginning to stumble over my apologies, and by how sharply I am watching her pretty face for any signs of her coming around."
    "Why I care so much about her feelings, I don't know, but I rationalize that it's better to be on her good side than her bad."
    rm "You must be speaking of Vittoria and Vincenza, surely. I must doubly apologize for also being absent when you arrived."

    S "Vertu partners are like... having an older sister to help you, and being the older sister as well."
    S "More than simply sharing this room, we are meant to share our triumphs with each other, and split the burden of our tribulations."
    C "That's pretty poetic sounding, huh?"
    "Honestly, I couldn't care less about any of that flowery language, and it probably shows in my flat tone of voice."

    S "By chance I was the odd one out in our year and received no Vertu, that is, until we heard you were transferring in."
    "She keeps saying \"Vertu\" with a strangely serious tone like it is some hallowed institution akin to marriage."
    C "(Like I'd ever marry a woman!)"
    "Just thinking about it brings the pair from earlier to mind, and I can already feel my brain churning inside my skull."
    C "You mentioned those two girls before... what were their names?"
    S "Vittoria and Vincenza? They have kind of a... {b}reputation{/b} here, so to speak, but they don't usually cross too far over the line."
    "I try to commit the names to memory because I know for sure I'll be lying awake tonight replaying the scene over in my head, thinking up all sorts of awesome comebacks to use next time I run into them."
    C "Y-Yeah, I'm fine, but I still haven't decided whether I'm pressing charges or not."
    "Sibyl laughs lightly at what I say half under my breath, but finding me not laughing along with her, quiets off quickly."
    S "If they really bothered you, I can come with you to speak with them. For all their quirks, they're not such bad girls and very understanding."
    C "I don't need you to help me."
    S "I'm your {b}Vertu{/b} partner, Clover, and this is what Vertu partners do. We look out for each other."
    C "Thank you, Sibyl, but I don't need your help."
    "The room goes quiet between us as soon as I saw the words with a cold tone of annoyance rising clearly in my voice as I speak the words."
    "I continue folding the clothes I take out of my luggage while turned away from Sibyl behind me. I consider apologizing to her that instant, but decide against it."
    C "(That's honestly how I feel, and it's better that she doesn't get too attached to me anyway.)"
    S "Did I come on too strong? I know you only {b}just{/b} got here, but I have been so excited to finally meet you."
    "I can practically {b}feel{/b} the disappointment in her voice, and it's making me feel like the absolute worst person alive."
    C "Sibyl—"
    "Turning around to face Sibyl, I'm surprised that I don't find her in tears, or even with a frown on her face."
    "Instead, I find an expression of utmost seriousness on her features, like my cold demeanor is her fault for which she needs to atone."
    C "Sibyl, I'm sorry, you've been super nice and everything, really, and I didn't mean to shut you down like that."
    C "I've just been going through some personal things, and I need some space right now, okay?"
    "She smiles up hopefully to me from where she sits on her bed, her blue eyes meeting my own and lingering in the connected gaze."
    C "(She's so much cuter when she's smiling.)"
    "Tearing my gaze away finally, and swallowing my pride somewhat, throw her a bone."
    C "But I will be counting on you to show me around campus and classes, and stuff like where to find the cafeteria and all that."
    S "Oh no, the cafeteria!"
    "The sudden change in mood startles me just as quickly."
    C "W-What wrong with it?"
    S "It's closed!"
    C "For how long?!"
    "Sibyl's chestnut curls sway and she turns her head aside toward a nearby alarm clock."
    S "Until tomorrow morning."
    "Relief washes over me, having thought for a moment there that I'd be starving due to a permanently closed cafeteria in addition to everything else here."
    S "I must have snoozed right through mealtime, and you must be famished too!"
    C "Well... kinda..."
    "As much as I might be thinking that I didn't want to rely on Sibyl any more than I need to, the sudden recognition of the emptiness in my stomach draws a meek acceptance."
    C "Are there, like, vending machines that we can use?"
    S "I'm afraid not... but, ah, let's go speak to Miss Woolsey, she will be able to sneak us into the cafeteria, I think."

    C "How did you both eer become friends?"
    S "Tanya is in our class but we became friends mostly because we kept getting seated beside one another in art club, and from there we kind of hit it off."

    C "That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?"
    "Both Sibyl and Tanya give me a hard look, and for just a moment I feel that maybe I shouldn't have said it aloud when she is clearly being so serious."
    C "But you have Tanya now, right? So you don't need me."

    "Both of them look almost shocked, like this is the most absurd thing they've ever heard, and not at all a totally rational idea."
    S "Okay, okay, I get it. No switching Vertus. It's a sacred bond between two girls that can never be broken."

    T "It is true that I would have preferred a different Vertu partner, but I respect the rules and traditions of this academy more than I dislike Sierra."

    "Deep down I know it was foolish to have assumed some random person entering the room would be my roommate, and I don't even know why I thought it was here to begin with."

    "I glance back briefly at Tanya as she sighs and tosses a hand to rest at her hip."
    T "Hey, are you alright, Clover?"
    "The soft tone of concern about a girl she barely knows kind of annoys me, and I cannot stop myself from letting it show."
    C "What does it matter to you anyway? You're not my roommate, Sibyl is. Don't you have your own Virtue to worry about?"
    "Tanya's tone again turns, this time more firmly, which is really no surprise with how obstinate I'm being toward her."
    T "Vertu. It's called a {b}vertu{/b}, and it is a foundational aspect of this academy."
    "Tanya corrects me with a measure of her fading patience clear in her voice, but some of the concern returns as she continues on."
    T "It matters to me because it matters to Sibyl."
    T "You're all she's thought about {b}all day{/b}. She's barely said a word to me today that wasn't about {b}you{/b}!"
    T "So please, just come on and let's hurry back before the bell rings for curfew."
    "Tanya reaches out toward me, which I don't realize until her hand is on my own."
    "I quickly brush it off and shove back at her."
    C "Just leave me alone!"
    T "Augh!"
    "I'm actually a little surprised by the strong huff of frustration that comes from Tanya after how understanding she was being just a moment before."
    "My petulant behavior has clearly ticked her off. Her hair is ever so slightly amiss from my shove, however light it was, and her cheeks are flushed light pink."
    T "Don't you know how {b}hard{/b} Sibyl is trying to help you? Could you please at least {b}try{/b} to not fight her the whole way?"
    C "Well I didn't {b}ask{/b} for her to do anything for me."
    T "She does it because you're her Vertu partner and, more than that, because it's the right thing to do."
    T "I don't know what she sees in you, but something has convinced her that you need help that only she can provide."
    C "I don't {b}need{/b} any {b}help{/b}."
    "My defiant snap only makes Tanya groan with frustration."
    T "That's {b}exactly{/b} what she said you would say. You're {b}infuriating{/b}, you know that?"
    T "There's {b}clearly{/b} something {b}wrong{/b} with you when you come at everything with all that bad attitude."
    "Amidst her tirade, Tanya steps closer, nearly backing me into a fish tank."
    T "Maybe {b}she{/b} isn't pissed off, but {b}I{/b} sure am! And the worst part is that I've only known you for a single day!"
    T "You should count yourself fortunate that Sibyl has such patience and compassion to put up with your behavior."
    "Tanya's rant doesn't scare me. I've faced worse language, and half of it is just praising Sibyl anyway."
    "Under my breath, I hiss a quiet \"if you love her so much, why don't you marry her\" like a devilish little imp, and it succeeds in making little miss best friend beet red to the face."
    "Tanya nearly looks like she's about to claw my face off, but instead pushes back off of me to turns away and stomp out of the aquarium."
    "With the angry presence before me suddenly gone, I just slump down on the ground right there with my back against the fish tank."
    C "(She was the one trying to get all up in my business. She was asking for that, right?)"
    "The irritable mood brought on by Tanya's presence quickly fades back into the creeping morose, and consequently my brain comes right back around to everything that just happened."
    "Of everything Tanya said, what is most strange to me is her supposition that Sibyl feels she's uniquely equipped to resolve all my problems."
    C "(That's totally off base. I haven't breathed a word about my parents'... issues. And it's not like she'd be able to get them to make up anyway.)"

    O "Clover, we know you hate us already, so we're just going to tell you this outright."
    H "Your attitude is unpleasant and is turning away everyone you come into contact with."

    "I wince after finishing, expecting raucous laughter out of Sibyl, but to my surprise, she's merely curious when I dare to peek back at her face."
    S "Wow, that's quite a mouthful, huh? Where did you learn that?"
    "The shame of the question weighs on me again, and I draw my blonde hair across my face to hide once more."
    C "I was pretty deep into a goth phase in middle school."
    S "That explains this photo!"
    C "(Wait, what?)"
    "I toss my hair away quickly to confirm what I'd most feared. In picking up the photo of Abraxas, I exposed the one underneath to view."

    S "How {b}did{/b} you get all that dye out of your hair?"

    C "O-Oh, well... my hair is actually dyed from about here down."
    S "Really? I doesn't look damaged at all."
    "Sibyl reaches out, unbidden, to feel the ends of my hair. It's even more unbearable than I could possibly have expected it to be."

    C "(This is {b}not{/b} how I wanted to \"open my heart\", Dad!)"
    C "You don't think I'm weird, Sibyl? For doing all this silly goth stuff?"
    "Sibyl laughs shortly, not with malice, but apparently at how silly my own question is."
    S "Of course not, Clover. We all do silly things sometimes."
    "A soft flush emerges on Sibyl's cheeks as she refuses to elaborate what she is clearly thinking of in her head, but she easily enough shrugs it off to finish her thought."
    S "Besides, you shouldn't be afraid to show who you are. You might meet people who share the same interests that way."
    C "I understand what you're saying, but you have to {b}promise{/b} me you won't tell {b}anyone{/b} about this."
    "It's clear that Sibyl doesn't agree with my request, but honors it anyway, and motions again to the photo."
    S "Are these your friends?"
    C "In middle school."
    S "Not anymore?"
    C "No. When high school started we all quit the goth stuff, two of them got boyfriends, and the third made softball her {b}entire{/b} life."
    S "I'm sorry to hear that, Sibyl. You look like you had a lot of fun together."
    "A quiver of a sob threatens to burst up through my chest but ultimately dies there."
    "It's a surprise because I've long since written off all three of them from my life ever since we went our separate ways, but nostalgia, it seems, almost got the best of me."
    C "We did. Honestly, it was... kind of hard, starting high school like that, with no friends, and no place to belong."
    C "(Oh God, what am I {b}saying{/b}? I don't need to \"open my heart\" {b}this{/b} much!)"
    "But as I say it, Sibyl says something that makes me dazed with realization."
    S "That's one of the reasons I wanted to come to Prudence Prep. The Vertu system ensures we're never alone and always have a supportive environment around us."
    "Not hearing me reply, Sibyl stops to look back at me in concern, whispering my name wih uncertainty."
    C "(Mom, Dad, I'm {b}so{/b} sorry...)"
    "All at once I realize what I fool I've been, feeling like being sent here to the academy was some kind of punishment, or abandonment."
    "Now I finally come to realize that they did it all for me."
    "My parents surely miss me just as much as I miss them, but between my troubles fitting in at school, and the complex home life with the divorce..."
    C "(They just wanted me to be happy. That's all they wanted for me.)"
    "Tears start rolling down my cheeks thicker than a monsoon, and Sibyl worriedly calls my name again, but I reach out to touch her arm to calm her concern"
    C "I'm sorry, I just... need a moment to process some things, like, in my head."
