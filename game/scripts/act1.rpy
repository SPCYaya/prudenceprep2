    "A warm breath puffs up through my chest and escapes between my chapped lips, a soft wisp born into the frigid late January air."
    "Another particularly heavy huff flutters through the the straight cut bangs of my flaxen blonde hair, sending little white flakes fluttering down before me."
    C "And now it's snowing too. Wonderful."
    "I stop to ruffle my heavy back and forth, casting off all the snow which had started to accumulate atop my head."
    "Then, with a frown solidly plastered on my face, I hump the duffel strap more securely over my shoulder and continue down the long wooded lane."
    C "(\"When we were your age, we walked to school up hill both ways in the snow!\")"
    "I can almost {b}hear{/b} the voice of my grandparents in my mind as I trudge along slowly toward the school I'm tranferring into part way through the year."
    "I'm already dressed in my new uniform, a very girly pink and white outfit which is totally unlike what I used to wear at my old school, even after I dumped my old wardrobe."
    "As much as I dread finally reaching the end of this lane, the cute uniform is secretly the one thing I actually kind of like — with one exception."
    "Whether the size is wrong for my scrawny body or because I'm undertaking this long trek while lugging nearly my entire worldly belongings, the warm white tights just are {b}not{/b} cooperating."
    C "(Drooping here, bunching there...)"
    "I perform an inelegant half jig for a few steps, trying to correct the tights around my legs as I walk."
    "A wave of relief washes over me when I sight the stately buildings of Prudence Preparatory Academy and the prominent statue of the Virgin Mary a little further down the way."
    "Not because I'm excited to get to school, of course, but merely because it means I'm almost done with this stupid walk."
    "Turning about to face the empty lane in the way I had just come with the building to my back, I stop where I stand to fix my tights."
    "My fingers dig under my skirt to pinch and dig at the tight fabric which runs up to my waist, hoping it sort it out with finality before I arrive."
    g1 "Dear me, Vincenza, and the in the sight of the Virgin Mary too."
    g2 "Oh, Vittoria, you know that the Virgin Mary always watches over us."
    "Unexpectedly from behind floats a pair of voices and a titter of laughter against the quiet of the evening dust of snowfall."
    "Before my mind can process it any further, a sudden weight presses around the back of my neck and upon my shoulders."
    O "The proper young ladies of the academy do such things in the confines of their own rooms."
    "The second girl's voice is close, close enough for me to feel the warmth of her breath tickle the left side of my face."
    "Flipping my head suddenly to the side, I catch sight of the face of the girl in question. She wears a soft grin upon a graceful pale face, set below sharp but cheerful eyes."
    "From her head falls a stream of fine silver hair across her face, styled with a neat, boyish look that oddly doesn't contrast at all with the uniform."
    H "Maybe she isn't a proper young lady at all?"
    "A soft touch against the small of my back announces the arrival of the first girl, and it remains as she swoops close across my other side in a flutter of voluminous silvery curls toward my front."
    "When my head flips back the other way, I find that this girl shares similar features to the first, albeit a very different, much more feminine aura also very much befitting of the uniform."
    "The first thought through my brain is that they must be sisters, if not twins, and the foreign accent common between them only adds to the similarity."
    "The latter girl draws close to my face, reaching a hand toward my chin to guide my head this way and that to inspect of my features."
    C "(What... the hell is happening?)"
    H "A young lady for sure, but the question of her {b}propriety{/b} remains."
    O "You've kept us waiting, Clover. We have a very important meeting to attend."
    "Frozen in place with confusion and uncertainty, the pair continue on their back and forth with barely an acknowledgement of their hands {b}all over{/b} my body."
    "With her right arm still heavy around my shoulders, her left heedlessly picks at the leftmost strap of my jumper skirt, following it slowly all the way up my chest."
    C "My bus was late. Could you not—!"
    "I might have totally forgotten that I had my skirt hiked up to pick at my tights when I was suddenly beset upon, but the girl on my right certainly hasn't."
    "The hand of hers which isn't on my small of my back drops from my chin and brushes against the hand I was using to fix my tights, only to go further still, picking up where I had left off."
    C "W-Where do you think you're touching!?"
    H "Oh my, and with your uniform so disarrayed. Please allow me to assist. You want to make a good first impression for your Vertu, is that right?"
    "She pulls at the tights bunching around my knees and slides the palm of her hand up my leg with it, smoothing the thin material across my thighs."
    "My body tingles with the smoothness of her touch, however stiff I am with the shock and confusion of someone acting so out of the ordinary and touching me places few would dare."
    O "The poor little thing's frozen solid. Can we not keep her just a little longer, Vittoria?"
    "The strap of my jumper is released from the second girl's fingers, but rather than remove them, she goes yet further to lay her hand across my chest."
    C "D-Don't—"
    "Her fingers tease their tips slowly between the buttons of my blouse, catching just slightly on each as she trails her way up to straighten the pink necktie at the very top."
    "To say I'm flustered is an understatement with how fiercely my cheeks are ablaze. I'm not usually one who likes handsy people, and this is going {b}way{/b} beyond handsy."
    H "We were only asked to deliver her room key, Vincenza, and we are late ourselves as you rightly pointed out."
    "The first girl's palm glides well higher than it has any right to up the inside of my thigh, and still further beyond to flatten out with the tights out around my hip."
    "A small shudder passes through my body, from my ears which the one girls keeps speaking into, all the wya down to the hand pressed closely upon the small of my back."
    O "Pity..."
    "Distracted and slowed from logical thought by the strange caresses all over my body, it's only then that my brain come to the heart of the matter."
    C "W-Wait, room key?"
    "With a soft giggle, the first girl's fingers clip against my stomach where the white tights meet their end, followed by the hard, cold touch of something entirely inhuman against my bare skin."
    "I quiver instinctively against the harsh cold metal wedged between my skin and my tights, breaking the dumb stupor the mysterious pair of girls had put me in."
    C "H-Hyah! What did you—!?"
    "The heavy duffel strap still slung over my shoulder finally drops off as I shake about like I had suddenly burst into flame, trying to fish out the object from inside my tights."
    "I hold the offending item up before my face after withdrawing it to find a plastic id card with my face on it staring back, and a metal carabiner attached to it."
    C "(Room key.)"
    "Once my thought processes finally catches up to my comprehension of the object I'm currently holding, I spin about to let those handsy twins have it."
    C "Y-You—!"
    "But just as I am about to let loose on the two girls beside me I find that they're no longer clinging to me at all, which actually makes sense in how easily I was able to retrieve the key."
    "Arm in arm they go back strolling toward the academy like they weren't just a second ago groping me all over in the middle of the road up to the school."
    H "Le abbiamo sicuramente piegato gli spaghetti." # we definitely bent her spaghetti

    "I'm half confused and half {b}fuming{/b}. I can feel the heat swelling in my cheeks and in my chest, from which extra puffy breaths of air emerge from my lungs."

    "Most merely look at me curiously in passing while others try to engage me in friendly conversation more deep than directing me to Macaron Dormitory, which they call the \"new\" dorm."
    "All of them I give a half-hearted smile toward and brush past once I get what I need. Inside I'm still steaming hot with annoyance while replaying what those two girls did to me."

    C "S-Sorry, I—"
    "I catch my words quickly, finding the girl roused neither by the door opening or my apology, merely asleep on her bed."
    "I double check my card and the plaque outside the door, but the presence of two beds inside confirms my fears and I try to close the door behind me as silently as possible."
    C "(I forgot about the whole... roommate thing.)"
    "It's certainly going to be an adjustment from being an only child and having my own room. One of many adjustments."
    C "(If I keep my space from her it shouldn't be a problem,{b}hopefully{/b}.)"
    "Having been in such a tizzy thinking about the pair of girls from before, I approach my new roommate cautiously, ready for anything, but she still remains unstirred."
    C "(Just what is she up to...?)"
    "I quickly surmise that she unintentionally fell asleep."
    "Lying in full uniform crossways atop her bed, she lies in the classic pose one makes when she rests her head for \"just a moment\" and suddenly loses precious hours of the day."
    "A long, thin paper banner is strung across her body, draped loosely between the slim fingers of the sleeping figure where she once held it."
    "\"Welcome Clover!\" the banner reads in sparkling glitter lettering, and I realize that she too must have gotten caught up in my late arrival."
    "It's even decorated with all sorts of cute little drawings, including tons of shamrocks."
    C "(Because of my name, of course.)"
    "I've lost count by now of how many people over my lifetime have picked a clover out of the grass and pointed between it and me with a grin."
    "I momentarily feel guilty that I might have suspected her of something terrible, but that feeling passes when I recall that she's a total stranger no matter how innocent she may look while sleeping."
    "The girl herself is sleeping soundly, lying with her head turned aside away my the edge of the bed, but by leaning in further I can see her features more clearly."
    "That she's gorgeous is plainly evident. Long chestnut curls stream from her head down her back and side, of which I am most jealous, but it doesn't stop there."
    C "(Her eyelashes are so long...)"
    "I look twice, just to be sure she isn't wearing mascara, but I detect no trace of {b}anything{/b} at all."
    C "(How can she just {b}effortlessly{/b} be this cute?)"
    "It's only recently that I've been trying to embrace my \"cute\" side, but it's anything but easy to compete with girls like this who are natural beauties."
    "Her cheeks are smooth and fair, with high cheek bones and large eyes that complete her charming profile."
    "Further below, her pale pink lips tremble and part ever so slightly with the little flickers of a dream in progress playing cross her sleeping features."
    #TODO insert bed creak here
    "The sudden creak of the bed when I shift more weight against it draws me out of my trance, and I realize quickly just how far I've learned over her face."
    C "(W-What am I {b}doing{/b}?)"
    "Pulling myself quickly away the bed, I turn around again toward my own, but my thoughts are still elsewhere."
    "My mind lingers on the mental images of my roommate's sleeping face longer than I would like, and my chest thumps softly in my ears."
    C "(It's been a long day... I'm tired.)"
    "The explanation fits neatly in my mind and I think nothing more of it, instead turning to un-package my stuffed duffel while thinking back on those rude girls from before."
    rm "Clover?"
    "The words float out airily behind me, soft enough for them to tickle at my ears while my brain steams hotly within my skull."
    "Once it worms its way into the front of my brain, I whip back around just as quickly toward my suddenly very awake roommate propped up on one arm."
    "More awake than before, anyway. Her long lashes lay heavy over her crisp blue eyes and a soft pout from being pulled out of her dream remains on her lips."
    C "What do you want?"
    "I just sort of... blurt it out while my brain is still churning, and immediately realize how rude that must sound."
    "Before I can say anything more, I'm caught speechless when she tosses her brunette curls with the back of her hand and unexpectedly winces with her eyes cast downward."
    rm "A better introduction than {b}this{/b}. How silly of me to have fallen asleep..."
    "My heart skips a beat as I watch her suffer my rude greeting after having gone to such lengths to welcome me into the room she lives in."
    "Struggling to find the right balance of apologizing for being awful and keeping my distance, I brush a hand through my own fair tresses in a show of casual detachment."
    C "Sorry, I was just surprised to hear you. I'm super late, sore from lugging my bag all the way here, and two crazy girls groped me on the way here."
    "Why I care enough about her feelings to not just dismiss her outright, I do not know, but I rationalize that it's better to be on her good side than her bad."
    rm "I'm so sorry, I meant to be there when you arrived to help you."
    rm "Oh right, my name is Sibyl!"
    "She stills seems half asleep to me with her her thoughts are coming all at once, but her dopey face is too cheerful and happy to object too strongly against."
    C "Umm... happy to meet you, Sibyl. So we're going to be roommates, huh?"
    "It's merely a polite greeting and rhetorical question, and so I turn about to begun unpacking before I get any more caught up in her expressions."

            "My tone comes out pretty dark, and Sibyl apparently chooses not to pry into it any further."
    "Correctly surmising that I had discarded the dull school literature at first glance, she launches into her own explanation."
    S "Vertu partners are like... having a best friend - or an older sister - to help you, and to be that person for your partner as well."
    S "More than simply sharing this room, we are meant to share our triumphs with each other, and split the burden of our tribulations."
    C "That's pretty poetic sounding, huh?"
    "Honestly, I couldn't care less about any of that flowery language, and it probably shows in the flat tone of voice which my reply sounds out with."
    C "(We share a room. We're roommates.)"
    "But somehow it feels like Sibyl definitely cares in some way that goes unspoken despite how she holds off on lecturing me any further about it while I unpack my duffel."
    S "Do you need some help unpacking?"
    "Even though she's on the other side of the room, it still {b}feels{/b} like she's hovering around me."
    C "No."
    "The momentary silence which follows is comfortable to me, but seemingly not to Sibyl."
    S "Your my first Vertu partner, you know that? I admit to having been a little envious of my peers who have had theirs since we enrolled."
    C "(And there she goes again.)"
    "Not to be deterred by my short reply, Sibyl continues on without my half of the conversation to keep it going."
    S "By chance I was the odd one out in our year and received no Vertu, that is, until we heard you were transferring in."
    "She keeps saying \"Vertu\" with a strangely serious tone like it is some hallowed institution akin to marriage."
    C "(Like I'd ever marry another girl in the first place...)"
    "Just thinking about two girls together like that brings the pair from earlier to mind, and I can already feel my brain churning inside my skull."
    "I know for sure I'll be lying awake tonight replaying the scene over and over in my head, thinking up all sorts of awesome comebacks to use next time I run into them."
    S "Clover, are you alright?"
    C "Y-Yeah, I'm fine."
    S "Maybe I didn't make a good first impression on account of dozing off, but I really would like to help you as I am able."
    C "I don't need you to help me."
    S "I'm your {b}Vertu{/b} partner, Clover, and this is what Vertu partners do. We look out for each other."
    C "Thank you, Sibyl, but I don't need your help."
    "The room goes quiet between us as soon as I say the words with a cold tone of annoyance rising clearly in my voice."
    "I continue folding the clothes taken out of my luggage while turned away from Sibyl behind me. An apology is considered, but I decide against it."
    C "(That's honestly how I feel, and if she doesn't like it, it's better that she doesn't get too attached to me anyway.)"
    S "Have I come on too strong? I know you only {b}just{/b} got here, but I have been so excited to finally meet you."
    "I can practically {b}feel{/b} the disappointment in her voice, and it's making me feel like the absolute worst person alive."
    C "Sibyl—"
    "With a short sigh I turn around to face Sibyl and am surprised that I don't find her in tears, or even with a frown on her face."
    "Instead, I find an expression of utmost concern on her features, like my cold demeanor is her fault and not entirely my stubbornness."
    C "Sibyl, I'm sorry, you've been super nice and everything, really, and I didn't mean to shut you down like that."
    C "I've just been going through some personal things, and I need some space right now, okay?"
    "She smiles up hopefully to me from where she sits on her bed, her blue eyes meeting my own and lingering in the connected gaze."
    "I tear my gaze away from hers, and swallowing my pride somewhat, throw her a bone."
    C "But I will be counting on you to show me around campus and classes, and stuff like where to find the cafeteria and all that."
    S "Oh no, the cafeteria!"
    "The sudden change in mood startles me just as quickly."
    C "W-What wrong with it?"
    S "It's closed!"
    C "For how long!?"
    "Sibyl's chestnut curls sway and she turns her head aside toward a nearby alarm clock."
    S "Until tomorrow morning."
    "Relief washes over me, having thought for a moment there that I'd be starving due to a permanently closed cafeteria in addition to everything else here."
    S "I must have snoozed right through meal time, and you must be famished too! Have you eaten already?"
    C "Well... kinda... not really."
    "As much as I might be thinking that I didn't want to rely on Sibyl any more than I need to, the sudden recognition of the emptiness in my stomach draws a meek acceptance of the situation."
    C "Are there, like, vending machines that we can use?"
    S "I'm afraid not... but, ah, let's go speak to Miss Woolsey, she will be able to help us."
    "Not that I am in any way unwilling to go scavenge in the academy's kitchens, but I {b}do{/b} fear drawing the wrath of some mean old teacher within hours of my arrival."
    C "I'll be fine until the morning, I promise. We don't need to go wake a teacher."
    S "Nonsense! She's our dorm mother, this is exactly what she's here for!"
    C "But won't she be mad?"
    S "Miss Woolsey? No way, she's super easygoing, I promise. She's our athletics teacher, you know."

    "My eyes linger upon Sibyl while they both wander off to fetch another tray for Tanya. They're obviously close already, even after just half a school year."

    C "(She sure has strong opinions about fruit.)"
    S "The way I see it, we need more strawberries, and star fruits, and pawpaws, and whatnot. The stranger the better."
    C "How did you two ever become friends?"
    S "We became friends mostly because we kept getting seated beside one another in art club, and from there we kind of hit it off."
    "With Tanya still deep into her breakfast it's mostly Sibyl who keeps engaging me in conversation, though at my next question Tanya does huff angrily into her yogurt parfait."
    C "Uh huh. And who's Sierra."

    S "At first I thought it was fortuitous when they told me I was the odd girl out and had no Vertu partner. I had a {b}whole room{/b} to myself for the very first time in my life."
    C "Do you want it back? Maybe there's an extra room I can camp out in."
    "Sibyl seemingly ignores my interjection and continues on without acknowledging my interruption at all."
    C "But I quickly found that my first few weeks were nothing but eating alone and going to classes alone while everyone else was still settling into things with their Vertus."
    S "Every night, I sat in my lonesome room with my only company being the empty bed across the way."
    C "That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?"
    "Both Sibyl and Tanya give me a hard look, and for just a moment I feel that maybe I shouldn't have said it aloud when she is clearly being so serious."
    C "But you have Tanya now, right? So you don't need me."
    S "Tanya is a wonderful friend, but even gaining a friend in art club didn't make my regular dorm life any less solitary."

    "With thoughts elsewhere, I idly pace down the rows of shelves while scanning the spines. The titles float in my brain and back out again without processing any in particular."
    "One book's fancy spine gilded edges catch my attention so I pull it from the shelf without reading the title and subsequently flop down into a chair to open the book."
    "The words read through my brain without being processed as anything sensible, much like the titles before them."
    C "(Where did everything go so wrong?)"
    "I've only been here twenty-four hours and yet I've already been both sexually assaulted and then humiliated in front of the whole class."
    "But all of that just feels like extra bitter icing on the terrible cake of my life in recent weeks. My whole life fell apart before I even got here."
    "It feels like just yesterday that I was at home playing with my dog Abraxas in the yard and enjoying pizza and a movie every Monday night while sandwiched between my parents on the sofa."
    C "(Now I'm sure they're fighting over me, Abraxas, and everything else like we're both items to be traded and bartered!)"
    "I don't know when it happened, but the tickle of a wet drop running down my arm alerts to me both that my face is buried in one of my hands and that I'm just barely choking back tears."
    C "(God, I'm so pathetic. Like, \"barely holding it together\" type pathetic.)"
    "With the realization that I've flipped through a few dozen pages of the book and not processed a single word, I drop my head onto my arms atop the the table and forgo reading altogether."

    C "(I'm all right. You're all right. Clover's all right. See? We're all right.)"
    "Releasing the tension to draw my fingers through my hair, I run them up and through to toss my blonde tresses out in a physical manifestation of doing away with my emotional instability."
    C "Hahn..."
    "I sit still like I'm calm, trying to will away the resurging angst, but deep down I can feel the pain welling back up inside me."
    "It's just at that moment that the door clicks open. My head raises instinctively."
    C "Sibyl?"
    "There's a light swell in my chest which surprises even me as I look expectantly toward the doorway."
    "But it's not luxurious mahogany curls which I see flutter through the doorway. Rather, it's straight black locks shining like a negative of my own."
    T "So this is where you ran off to."
    "Deep down I know it was foolish to have assumed I would know some random person entering the room, let alone that it would be my roommate."
    C "Y-Yeah. I just needed some time alone."
    "Knowing that my expression must be quite dark, I turn my head aside away from Tanya back toward the fish swimming in the tanks."
    "My tone comes out rather dismissively, having no particular feelings about making nice with my new roommate's best friend that I only just met a few hours ago."
    T "That's what Sibyl thought."
    C "She knows me so well."
    "What should probably be a positive comment is really ironic acclaim when I speak the words, and I think maybe Tanya can also tell judging by her rising impatience."
    T "Look, it's almost curfew time so you really should be getting back to the dorms."
    C "(Curfew? Is it that late already?)"
    C "...Why didn't Sibyl come for me?"
    T "Huh?"
    "The question must have caught her off guard because she's momentarily quieted by the question. I'm a little surprised myself."
    C "She's the one always saying that we're supposed to support each other, and she didn't even come looking for me when I vanished?"
    T "We {b}both{/b} went looking for you, Clover, and a couple others besides. It's a big school."
    "I glance back briefly at Tanya as she sighs and shakes her head side to side, then tosses a hand to rest at her hip to reset."
    T "Hey, are you alright, Clover?"
    "The soft tone of concern about a girl she barely knows kind of annoys me, and I cannot stop myself from letting it show."
    C "What does it matter to you anyway? Don't you have your own \"Virtue\" to worry about?"
    "Tanya's tone again turns, this time more firmly, which is really no surprise with how obstinate I'm being toward her."
    T "Vertu. It's a French word, {b}Vertu{/b}, and it is a foundational aspect of this academy."
    "Tanya corrects me with a measure of her fading patience clear in her voice, but some of the concern also remains as she continues on pestering me."
    T "It matters to me because it matters to Sibyl."
    T "You're all she's talked about {b}all day{/b}. She's barely said a word to me today that wasn't about {b}you{/b}!"
    T "So please, just come on and let's hurry back before the bell rings for curfew."
    "Tanya reaches out toward me, which I don't realize until her hand is on my own. I quickly brush it off and shove back at her."
    C "Don't touch me!"
    T "Augh!"
    "I'm actually a little surprised by the strong huff of frustration that comes from Tanya after how understanding she was being just a moment before."
    "My petulant behavior has clearly ticked her off. Her hair is ever so slightly amiss from my shove, however light it was, and her cheeks are flushed light pink."
    T "Don't you know how {b}hard{/b} Sibyl is trying to help you? Could you please at least {b}try{/b} to not fight her the whole way?"
    C "Well I didn't {b}ask{/b} for her to do anything for me."
    T "She does it because you're her Vertu partner and, more than that, because it's the right thing to do."
    T "I don't know what she sees in you, but something has convinced her that she knows exactly what kind of support you need."
    C "I don't {b}need{/b} any {b}help{/b}."
    "My defiant snap only makes Tanya groan with frustration."
    T "That's exactly what she said you would say. You're infuriating, you know that?"
    T "There's {b}clearly{/b} something {b}wrong{/b} with you when you come at everything with all that bad attitude."
    "Amidst her tirade, Tanya steps closer, nearly backing me into a fish tank."
    "It's a strange thought to have, but she's almost pretty like this, slightly dishevelled and skin touched soft pink with anger."
    T "Maybe {b}she{/b} isn't pissed off, but {b}I{/b} sure am! And the worst part is that I've only known you for a single day!"
    T "You should count yourself fortunate that Sibyl has such patience and compassion to put up with your behavior."
    T "You don't {b}deserve{/b} to have someone so special as a Vertu partner, you know that?"
    "Tanya's rant doesn't scare me. I've had worse language thrown in my face before, and half of that was just praising Sibyl anyway."
    "As my reprisal, I hiss a childish \"if you love her so much, why don't you marry her\" which succeeds beautifully in getting under little-miss-best-friend's skin."
    "Tanya nearly looks like she's about to claw my face off, but instead pushes back off of me to turn away and stomp out of the aquarium."
    "With the irate presence before me suddenly gone, I slump down on the ground right there with my back against the fish tank."
    C "(She was the one trying to get all up in my business. She was asking for that.)"
    "The irritable mood brought on by Tanya's presence gradually fades back into the creeping darkness, and consequently my brain play right back everything that just happened."
    "Of everything Tanya said, what is most strange to me is her supposition that Sibyl feels she's uniquely equipped to resolve all my problems."

    "But somehow I just can't find the dread or fury inside that I could before."

    S "I meant to let you have your time alone but as the clock kept ticking later I just got more and more worried."
    C "Is the penalty for braking curfew that steep?"
    S "No, it's not that, I just... wanted to make sure you were okay."
    C "Why?"
    S "As time went on and on and you did not show up to our room I was afraid you might have done something more rash than just skip classes."
    C "(It's she being a little too worried about me here?)"
    "I cannot begin to fathom what she thought I might do. I'm already regretting merely having skipped dinner for the second day in a row."
    C "N-No, I mean, why do you care so much about me? You don't even {b}know{/b} me."
    S "I know you enough to know that you're in a lot of pain, and I know that you've been through a big life adjustment by coming here."
    S "That much you told me yourself."
    C "(Which is to say that she's inferred more?)"

    S "I'll wait as long as it takes for you to come around, and when you're ready to talk about it, I'll be right here."
    S "Oh, and before I forget, your phone was ringing like crazy earlier."
    "The heat which had slowly been returning to body all of a sudden dissipates."
    "I jump across the room and clutch at my smartphone and find one missed call, and a text message following it."
    "I read out the text three times at least: \"Hi, sweetie, how was your first day at school?\""
    "It's from my mom. She's asking about my first day at school."
    "Like it wasn't half her idea to drag me out of my old school and abandon me here at this one."
    "Like she isn't conspiring with my dad to tear our family apart and destroy our lives together."
    "Like she cares a single bit about me after all that."

    "Whatever Sibyl thinks is so great about it, I cannot possibly understand."
    "What would be {b}great{/b} is if she said it was all some awful practical joke, I can come home, and we were going to be a family again."
    C "(But that's definitely not going to happen.)"
    "Contrary to having just thrown my phone on the bed, I immediately swipe it off onto the floor and collapse face-first onto the bed instead."
    S "I've found, Clover, that I feel better when I talk out my issues. Would you like to try it?"
    "It's clear she's being cautious in her pressure at what is definitely a sore subject, which is annoying in itself."

    "There's a silence for a few moments before Sibyl's soft, calming voice returns."
    S "I truly would not, but I also might be able to empathize with your troubles more than you might think."
    "After showing absolutely no signs that I am going to say anything more, Sibyl finally leaves me to my own misery once again."

    C "It's a word of mystic meaning in the system of the Gnostic Basilides applied to the {i}megas archōn{/i}, {i}princeps{/i} of the 365 {i}ouranoi{/i}."
    "I wince after finishing, expecting raucous laughter out of Sibyl, but to my surprise she's merely curious about all the strange things I've just said aloud."
    S "Wow, I have no idea what any of that means but it's quite a mouthful, huh? Where did you learn all that?"
    "The shame of the question weighs on me again and I draw my blonde hair across my face to hide in my traditional fashion."
    C "I was pretty deep into a goth phase in middle school."
    S "That explains this photo!"
    C "(Wait, what?)"
    "I toss my hair away quickly to confirm what I'd most feared. In picking up the photo of Abraxas, I exposed the one underneath to view."
    S "Wow..."
    C "(Oh no, here comes the mockery!)"
    S "How {b}did{/b} you get all that dye out of your hair?"
    C "H-Huh?"
    "Sibyl holds up the photo of me and my three friends decked out in the most embarrassing, all-black outfits we could possibly muster, each of us with pitch black hair."
    C "O-Oh, well... my hair is actually dyed from about here down."
    "Sibyl reaches out, unbidden, to twirl my hair through her fingers and tease the ends of my hair. It's even more unbearable than I could possibly have expected it to be."
    S "Really? It's still so smooth and I can barely tell it's dyed."
    C "I'm pretty good with hair dye. Lots of experience 'cause of the... you know."
    C "(This is {b}not{/b} how I wanted to \"open my heart\", Dad!)"
    C "You don't think I'm weird, Sibyl? For doing all this stupid goth stuff?"
    "Sibyl laughs shortly, not with malice, but apparently at how absurd my own question is."
    S "Of course not, Clover. We've all done goofy things, haven't we?"
    "A soft flush emerges on Sibyl's cheeks despite her reluctance to elaborate what she is clearly thinking of in her head."
    S "Besides, you shouldn't be afraid to show who you are. You might meet people who share the same interests if you're more open about yourself and your interests."
    C "I understand what you're saying Sibyl, but you have to {b}promise{/b} me you won't tell {b}anyone{/b} about this."
    "It's clear that Sibyl doesn't agree with my request but honors it anyway and motions again to the photo."
    S "Are these your friends?"
    C "From middle school."
    S "Not anymore?"
    "The way I toss the photo aside should provide enough of an answer, but if I've already said this much, a little more won't kill me."
    C "No. When high school started we all quit the goth stuff. Two of them got boyfriends, the third made softball her {b}entire{/b} life, and I stayed just... me."
    S "I'm sorry to hear that, Sibyl. You four of you look like you had a lot of fun together."
    "A quiver of a sob threatens to burst up through my chest but ultimately dies there."
    "It's a surprise because I've long since written off all three of them from my life ever since we went our separate ways, but nostalgia, it seems, almost got the best of me this time."
    C "We did. Honestly, it was... kind of hard, starting high school like that, with no friends, and no place to belong."
    C "(Oh God, what am I {b}saying{/b}? I did't mean to \"open my heart\" {b}this{/b} much!)"
    "But as I say it, Sibyl says something that dazes me with the sudden realization of some long obscured truth."
    S "That's one of the reasons I wanted to come to Prudence Prep. The Vertu system ensures we're never alone and always have a supportive environment around us."
    "Not hearing me reply, Sibyl stops to look back at me in concern, whispering my name wih uncertainty."
    C "(Mom, Dad, I'm {b}so{/b} sorry...)"
    "All at once I realize what I fool I've been, feeling like being sent here to the academy was some kind of punishment or abandonment."
    "Now I finally come to realize that they did this all for me. Being sent here was for {b}my{/b} benefit."
    "My parents surely miss me just as much as I miss them, but between my troubles fitting in at school, and the complex home life with their divorce..."
    C "(They just wanted me to be happy. That's all they've ever wanted for me.)"
    "Tears start rolling down my cheeks thicker than a monsoon, and Sibyl worriedly calls my name again, but I reach out to touch her arm to calm her concern."
    C "I'm sorry, I just... need a moment to process some things, like, in my head."
    S "Of course, Clover. Take all the time you need."
