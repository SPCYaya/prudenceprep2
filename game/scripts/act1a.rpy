    "I stop where I am to ruffle my flaxen blonde hair back and forth, casting off all the snow which has already begun to accumulate atop my head."

    "The voice of my grandfather echoes in my mind as I trudge along slowly toward the the faintly glowing windows of the school buildings down the lane. So far, this long driveway has been mercifully flat."
    "The school which I'm marching toward like death row inmate is where I'll be serving out the remainder of my freshman year of high school."
    "I'm already dressed in my new uniform: an exceptionally cute pink and white outfit, totally unlike what I used to wear at my old public school."
    "Just about everything related to this sudden transfer has been a headache but the new uniform is secretly something I actually kind of like — with one exception."
    "Whether it's my awkward body or because I'm lugging my entire worldly belongings against my hip, the warm white tights keeping the chill away are simply not cooperating."
    C "(They surely have a car that could have met me at the gate rather than force me to suffer exposure to the elements.)"
    "A wave of relief washes over me when I spy the forms of the stately buildings of Prudence Preparatory Academy emerging clearly from the white cover of light snowfall just ahead."
    "Beside what are likely the school buildings and dormitory, there is also a small chapel with a grand statue of some saint or another out front."

    O "The proper young ladies of this academy do such things in the confines of their own rooms."
    "The second girl, which by her voice was addressed as Vincenza, is close enough for me to feel the warmth of her breath tickle the left side of my face."
    "Flipping my head suddenly to the side, I catch sight of the face of the girl in question. She wears a soft grin upon a graceful face with relaxed eyes. She's pretty, but restrained; cool but confident."
    "From her head falls a stream of fine golden hair down her back, styled with a neat ponytail in a kind of boyish look that oddly doesn't contrast at all with the uniform." 
    H "Maybe she isn't a proper young lady at all?"
    "A hand grazed against the small of my back announces the arrival of the other girl. The touch remains there even as she swoops close across my other side in a flutter of voluminous golden curls toward my front."
    "When my head flips back the other way, I find that this girl, Vittoria, shares similar features to the first, albeit with a very different, classically feminine aura also very much suited to the uniform."
    C "(They're almost... otherworldy beautiful.)"
    "I would not doubt that the walk from the road to the school buildings had killed me, if only that the angles which emerged from the snow bore no wings upon their backs."
    "Without warning, the ponytail girl draws close to my face while reaching a hand toward my chin to guide my head this way and that to inspect of my features."
    O "Do your eyes need a check, Vittoria? She is just your type."
    H "A young lady for sure, Vincenza, but the question of her {b}propriety{/b} remains inconclusive."
    "The pair continue on their back and forth with barely an acknowledgement of their brash invasion of my personal space."
    "The first thought through my brain is that they must be sisters, if not twins, and the clearly foreign accent common between them only adds to the similarity."
    C "What... what is happening?"
    "I'm so caught off guard by the sudden appearance of these two girls and their heedless invasion of my personal space that I freeze in place, unsure what reaction such a strange situation calls for."
    O "You've kept us waiting, Clover. We have a very important rendezvous to make."
    C "(They know my name!?)"  
    "With her right arm still heavy around my shoulders, the girl hanging over my shoulder heedlessly picks at the leftmost strap of my skirt with her left, following it slowly all the way up my chest."
    "I might have totally forgotten that I had my uniform hiked up to pick at my tights when I was suddenly beset upon, but the girl in front of me certainly hasn't."
    "When I try to semi-politely shove off the handsy probing of the girl slumped across my shoulders, the other one suddenly becomes even more invasive."
    C "My bus was late— {b}hey{/b}!"
    H "Oh my, and with your uniform so disarrayed. Please allow me to assist."
    "The hand of hers which isn't on my small of my back brushes against my own still fighting to fix my tights, only to go further still in picking up where I had left off."
    C "(Is getting this close normal for Europeans!?)"
    H "You want to make a good first impression for your Vertu, isn't that right? You simply must look your best."
    "She pulls at the tights bunching around my knees and slides the palm of her hand up my leg with it, smoothing the thin material across my legs."
    "My cold thighs tingle with the sleekness of her touch but I am otherwise struck stiff with the surprise of someone gliding her hand way up to places strangers would not normally dare."
    O "The poor little thing's frozen solid. Can we not keep her just a little longer, Vittoria, to warm her up?"
    "The strap of my skirt is released from the second girl's fingers, but just as I think she's about to let me go she instead trails her fingers reach to straighten the pink necktie around my neck."
    C "Eueh...!"
    "A strange sound emerges from my lips as a consequence of all this odd attention. It too transforms into a soft puff of warm breath in the cold air before me."
    "To say I'm flustered is an understatement. I'm not usually one who likes touchy-feely types, not even from my grandma, and this is going {b}way{/b} beyond the forehead kisses she is known for."
    H "We were only asked to deliver her room key, Vincenza, and we are late ourselves as you rightly pointed out."
    "The first girl's palm glides well higher than it has any right to up the inside of my thigh, and still further beyond to flatten out with the tights out around my hip."
    "A small shudder passes through my body from my ear into which the one girl, Vincenza, keeps speaking into, all the way down to the hand pressed closely upon the small of my back."
    O "Pity..."
    "Distracted and slowed from logical thought by the strange caresses all over my body, it's only then that my brain finally comes to the heart of the matter."
    C "W-Wait, room key?"
    "With a soft giggle, the first girl's fingers clip against my stomach where the white tights meet their end, followed by the hard, cold touch of something entirely unnatural against my bare skin."
    C "H-Hyah! What did you—!?"
    "I quiver instinctively against the harshly frigid metal wedged between my skin and my tights, breaking the dumb stupor the mysterious pair of girls had put me in."
    "Shaking about like mad trying to fish out the object burning cold against the warm skin inside my tights, the offending item turns out to be a plastic id card with my face on it staring back and a metal carabiner attached to it."
    C "(Room 28.)"
    "Once my thought processes finally catch up to my comprehension of the object I'm currently holding, I spin about to let those handsy twins finally have a piece of my mind."
    C "Y-You—!"
    "But just as I am about to let loose on the two girls beside me I find that they're no longer clinging to me at all, which actually makes sense in how easily I was able to retrieve the key."
    "My eyes follow the trail in the thin snow cover to find the pair strolling gaily toward the academy like they weren't just a few seconds ago groping me all over in the middle of the road up to the school."

    S "You were a student here, Miss Woolsey?"
    mw "More than just a mere student, I was the president of the student council!"
    "It's actually kind of sad how proudly Miss Woolsey proclaims that she went from being the student council president to what is objectively the most pathetic teaching role at a school."
    mw "My high school masquerade ball was a big day for me in a lot of ways, so I'm glad you enjoyed it so much too. Which animal did you pick?"
    S "The options were sort of picked over but from what was left so I chose the kangaroo."
    "That I've been staring at my sandwich while devouring it should have indicated I don't particularly care to talk, but it seems that Miss Woolsey isn't content with reminiscing of her school days."
    mw "It's almost Valentine's Day already. That means the first academy-wide event you'll get to take part in is making chocolates for all your new friends, Clover!"
    C "Oh yeah?"

    mw "I know it must be difficult to transfer in part way through the school year but you'll have your Vertu, Sibyl, by your side every step of the way."
    "Miss Woolsey also picks up on my little faux pas easily enough, so it seems."
    C "(She might not actually be as thick as the average gym teacher. I should be more careful around her.)"
    "Much like Sibyl before, Miss Woolsey goes on to tell me how \"special\" being roommates is at this school. Sibyl nods seriously at what the teacher says, giving me an encouraging smile all the while which only makes my stomach flop over inside me."
    C "That's what Sibyl was telling me."
    "Returning my attention to my sandwich with a chill dismissal, I try to ignore the look that passes between Sibyl and my new teacher."
    mw "If you don't mind me asking, Clover, why did you choose to attend Prudence Prep?"
    C "I didn't {b}choose{/b} to be here. My parents {b}sent{/b} me here."
    C "(Like a lone button when you can't find the sweater to which it belongs. It just gets tossed in a drawer for safekeeping while you go about your life.)"
    "Miss Woolsey, while friendly, is being awfully persistent at trying to get me to open up when I have no intention of doing so, and the annoyance leads me to say more aloud than I want to."
    "The room couldn't be getting any chillier if we had left the refrigerator door open. I know I'm acting really terrible but I have a valid reason to be this rightfully touchy about the subject."
    C "(And it's not like either of them really cares about me anyway.)"
    "It's the teacher's job to look after me just as much as it is apparently Sibyl's responsibility to do the same as my \"Vertu\"."
    "There's a long silence after I speak where Miss Woolsey's gears are clearly spinning in her head trying to formulate a response to my brusque reply."
    S "Clover, I'm so sorry..."
    "But to my surprise, Sibyl reaches out to lay her hand on my arm first to offer her condolences without even knowing what I'm going through at all. I pull away suddenly from her touch as quickly and unexpectedly as she'd touched me."
    C "I don't need your apologies."
    mw "W-Well... I have long felt that the people I met here at the academy are like a second family to me, so if you ever need—"
    "She's just trying to console me, I know, but she unwittingly stepped right onto the land mine already primed to explode."
    C "I already {b}have{/b} a family, I don't need a second one!"
    "The long and arduous journey here, the muddled rush of emotions in the past few hours, and everything else swirling together in my skull draws yet another verbal jab which I cannot take back."
    "My shouting is shockingly ineffective on Sibyl, who only follows my angry outburst with a look of pity and understanding."
    S "Oh, Clover..."
    "It's unnerving, to see this strange reaction to me being so frigidly cold. Sibyl's soothing smile and big, sparkling eyes peering out at me drive right through my icy exterior to make my stomach flutter the half-digested sandwich within."
    C "(What could she possibly be thinking now? She doesn't know a single thing about me!)"
    "Sibyl might have the mysterious expression of utmost compassion and understanding on her face but my athletics teacher is only further troubled by everything that's happening."
    mw "I shouldn't have pried into your personal life, Clover, I'm sorry."
    C "I-It's fine..."
    C "(I'm sure she's thinking she's only made things worse with her persistent questioning. Maybe I can salvage my gym class grade after all.)"
    "Awkwardly, I try to cool down and smooth things over with the teacher despite Sibyl's strangely calm smile still being foremost in the jumble of my mind."
    mw "Just know that if there's anything you don't feel comfortable talking about with Sibyl, you can always call on me to lend an ear too."
    C "...Thanks."
    "I feel like an amoeba under a microscope by the way Sibyl keeps looking at me sympathetically, and then doubly so with how Miss Woolsey is still clearly fretting over our interaction."

    T "We {b}both{/b} went looking for you, Clover, and a couple others besides. It's a big school."
    "I glance back blankly at Tanya, unsure what to feel about the answer or how to follow it up. She follows with a sighs of dismay and shakes her head side to side, then tosses a hand to rest at her hip to reset."
    T "Hey, are you feeling alright, Clover?"
    "The soft tone of concern about a girl she barely knows ticks me off. I cannot stop myself from letting it come out through my words again."

    "Tanya's tone again turns, this time more firmly, which is really no surprise with how obstinate I'm being toward her."

    "Tanya corrects me with a measure of her fading patience clear in her choice of words and the hardness with which they are spoken, but some of the concern yet remains as she continues right on pestering me."

    T "That's exactly what she said you would say. You're infuriating, you know that?"
    T "Maybe {b}Sibyl{/b} isn't pissed off, but {b}I{/b} sure am! And the worst part is that I've only known you for a single day!"
    T "You should count yourself fortunate that Sibyl has enough patience and compassion to put up with your moody bullshit."
    "Amidst her tirade, Tanya steps closer, nearly backing me into a fish tank as she presses a finger angrily sharp into my chest. I'm taller than her, if only barely, but somehow she feels so much more dangerous in the moment."
    T "You {b}do{/b} need help. There's clearly something {b}wrong{/b} with you. Every time someone tries to help you or even say a single thing nice to you, you have to spit it back in their faces!"
    T "You don't {b}deserve{/b} someone as special as Sibyl for a Vertu partner, and if you aren't going to respect her, then {b}stay away{/b} from her!"
    "Tanya's rant doesn't scare me, even if she is stronger than she looks. I've had worse language thrown in my face before and half of that stupid rant was just praising Sibyl anyway."
    "As my reprisal, I hiss a childish \"if you love her so much, why don't you marry her\" which succeeds beautifully in getting under little-miss-best-friend's skin."
    "Tanya nearly looks like she's about to claw my face off but instead shoves me back against the fish tank to turn away and stomp out of the aquarium."

    "The warmth of my dorm room which had slowly been returning to body all of a sudden dissipates into thin air."
    "I jump across my bed to clutch at my smartphone. One missed call and a text message blink on the display. \"Hi sweetie, how was your first day at school?\""
    C "(Like she cares a single bit about me anymore!)"
    "It's from my mom. She's asking about my first day at school like it wasn't half her fault for abandon me here in the first place."
    "Or like she and Dad aren't tearing our family apart and destroy our lives together — the life I've always known and loved up until just recently."

    "But that's definitely not going to happen. They may try to hide it from me but I can tell how far gone relations are between Mom and Dad."
    "Contrary to the act of having just pitched my smartphone into the bed, I immediately swipe it back up again to be sure it's safe. It is, after all, my only precious line outside of this nightmare school."
    S "I've found, Clover, that I feel better when I talk out my issues. Would you like to try it?"

    "I storm out of the room with my passions ablaze but quickly cool off as I'm left alone to wander the academy without their stupid smirking faces in front of me."
    "With the hollow emptiness of my now-resolved conflict with the twins still lingering, I search the faces of the other students around me to refute what the they had said."
    "Most confirm my own suspicions that they are far too engaged with their own friends to notice me, but after passing a few more doors down the hallway a pair of students do look my way in passing."
    C "(I think they are in my homeroom.)"
    "My introduction was a spectacular failure so I had written off ever speaking to anyone from then on, but despite my fears the pair only looked curious about me when they looked my way."
    "I whip my head around after the first pair to semi-discreetly glance after them in the hallway and find them whispering to themselves when they pass."
    C "(Can I pull off \"cool\"? Probably not. \"Mysterious\"? Maybe. \"Beautiful\"? Sounds like a lot of work.)"
    "Some part of me refuses to accept those two classmates were merely curious about me and that they must have instead been secretly mocking me."
    "I would believe anything if it means not having to admit that Vittoria and Vincenza may have been right about this one thing, and even more dangerously, right about everything else too."
    "I anxiously glance at every passing girl in the hallways while heading back to my dorm room, all the while telling myself I can't possibly be mistaken in what I am feeling so strongly."

    "It's a relief when I finally get back to my room, far away from any invasively curious or potentially judgemental eyes."
    "To my surprise, a small cardboard box sits atop my desk. I slump my school bag onto the chair and peer over at it like it might explode in my face, or worse."
    C "(\"Clover Ipswich\". It's for me. From...)"
    "A strange mixture of excitement and dread fills my stomach, like it's full of butterflies on fire madly flapping their wings to put each other out but only fanning the flames harder in the process."
    "I step over to my bed and flop onto it in a daze, but ultimately my body is hypnotically drawn right back to the box on the desk."
    C "(Do Mom and Dad need me to sign some papers for their divorce? Is this box the sum of my inheritance after being entirely written out of their lives?)"
    "Many terrible thoughts, each one more awful than the last, pass through my head as I apprehensively trace the sharp edge of a pair of scissors around the tape holding the flaps closed."
    "I sit cross-legged on the bed with the package before me, then with a deep breath to expel my hesitation finally flip the cardboard flaps open."
    pause 0.5
    C "Abraxas!"
    "What greets me is a familiar goofy face which draws an equally goofy expression of my own."
    "Right on top is a whole bundle of the picture frames I used to keep on my desk. Topmost among them is my photo of my furry best friend from when he was still a puppy."
    "The other frames behind it I also recognize but strategically leave covered while I set the photos aside to eagerly dig through the rest of the box."
    C "(It's a whole care package!)"
    "Beneath those surprises lie yet more wonders — a veritable treasure trove of my favorite things, from my choice in candy bars to a full set of sparkly glitter gel pens."
    "The last thing I pull out of the box I can smell before I even see what's wrapped up in the glass jar."
    C "(It can't be...)"
    "But as I unwrap it, yes, it is."
    C "Mom's famous peanut brittle! I don't believe it!"
    "I say it out loud to my empty room, it's that unbelievable. This particular treat is something she only makes around Thanksgiving."
    C "(She must have made it special for me.)"
    "I unwrap a little piece eagerly and take a nibble out of it. The nostalgic tastes spreads across my tongue instantly, transporting me back home if only for a moment."
    "The second nibble is saltier, and more wet than the first. By the time I finish the little piece, the tears splash unceasingly onto my lap."
    "The colors of my room begin to smear and blend together, but a brush of the back of my hand against my eyes brings focus finally upon the folded letter waiting at the bottom of the box."
    "A new-found warmth fills my stomach more than the little piece of peanut brittle ever could, dousing the fires of anger and fear enough for me to read the note."
    "I fight back my tears through every word full of love and encouragement."
    C "(Mom... Dad...)"
    "I've always known deep down that my parents still love me, but seeing it written after unwrapping all the thoughtful gifts they've sent makes the weight of that love rest especially heavy in my chest."
    "They write nothing about the divorce that I know is still looming like the blade of a guillotine over everything."
    "The letter merely contains only the same love and comfort I've always known, and which I've been terribly missing since I left home."
    "I begin re-reading again from the top, the tears picking up in volume out of my eyes as I read the words written in familiar script."
    "I'm only through the first paragraph by the time my rampaging emotions overflow and I am forced to stuff my face into the pillow to muffle the wails of my bawling."

    "A soft clatter from across the room finally stirs me from my pillow. With a sniffle to contain my ugly runny nose, I glance up at it."
    "Sibyl stands at the door, leaning back against it, her face politely turned away from staring at me. There are tiny paint flecks across her nose and cheeks, no doubt evidence of her club activities."
    C "S-Sibyl..."
    S "Would you like to be alone, Clover?"
    "My gaze turns down toward the ground as I judge the state of my being. I find it poor but with the strength of an intense cathartic release buoying my head above water."
    C "No..."
    "Even so, my voice comes out shaky and quiet. I'm trembling all over, but I feel neither sad nor angry."
    "I pick up the letter again, read a few of the lines written there, and somehow find my head clearer than it has been in recent memory."
    "\"Keep your head up and your heart open. Good things are sure to find their way in if you let them.\""
    "I do what Dad asks, raising my head to regard Sibyl across the room."
    C "No. I'm... going to be alright. You can stay."
    "With an understanding smile that I've come expect from her, Sibyl sets down her bag and moves to sit on my bed across from me at a comfortable distance."
    S "What'cha got here?"
    "I can sense a little tentativeness in her actions like I'm some sort of wild animal eating seed out of her hand and she doesn't want to spook me. I find it more silly than annoying how careful she's being around me for the first time."
    C "A care package."
    S "From your parents?"
    "I offer a little nod instead of vocalizing and Sibyl responds with a pleasant \"How lovely!\" which rings just as sweetly in my ears as the peanut brittle did in my mouth."
    S "Would you like to show me?"
    "I distinctly feel as though she's treating me like a little kid but presently allow it with consideration toward my delicate emotional state."
    C "It's a whole bunch of my favorite things."
    "Digging into the peanut brittle, I offer her a piece which she gladly accepts."
    S "It's delicious!"
    "She probably has no idea how much this peanut brittle means to me, but she also probably deserves a little bit for having put up with me the past few days."
    "That's right, I am all but forced to admit that {b}maybe{/b} Sibyl was right about her \"storm clouds\", and that I have been a touch dramatic ever since I arrived at the academy."
    C "(All it takes is a little peanut brittle to remember I'm not out of my parents' hearts forever just because they suddenly sent me away.)"
    "None of this excuses what they've put me through so far, but after seeing all this I am unable to feel as hurt now as when they first kicked me out of our home to send me here."
    "Turning again to the photos, I pluck the photo of my beloved pet off the top of the stack to push toward Sibyl."
    C "And some of my photo frames too. It feels like I haven't seen Abraxas in months even though I know it's only been a week or two."
    S "What's a \"braxas\"?"
    "I'm rightly confused for a moment, an expression similarly shared by Sibyl, but when  what she asked finally gets through my head I burst out into a modest fit of laughter."
    S "D-Don't laugh at me! I don't know about everything!"
    C "\"Abraxas\" is my dog. That's his name."
    "It's only when I push the photo of Abraxas more firmly into her face that she finally understands."
    S "He's cute! How did you come up with the name?"
    "My gaze shifts away from Sibyl's face as I feel the surge of warmth I know to be intense embarrassment rush to color my cheeks."
    C "(Head up. Heart open.)"
    "I tell Sibyl all in the tiniest quiet voice I can manage, no matter how embarrassing it is to say it."
    C "It's a word of mystic meaning in the system of the Gnostic Basilides applied to the {i}megas archōn{/i}, {i}princeps{/i} of the three hundred sixty five {i}ouranoi{/i}."
    "I wince after finishing the recitation, expecting raucous laughter out of Sibyl, but to my surprise she's merely curious about all the strange things I've just said aloud."
    S "Wow, I have no idea what any of that means but it's quite a mouthful. Where did you learn all that?"
    "The shame of the question weighs on me again. With sweat beginning to gather on my forehead, I draw my blonde hair across my face to hide in my traditional fashion."
    C "I was pretty deep in an occult goth phase in middle school."
    S "That explains this photo!"
    C "(Wait, what?)"
    "I toss my hair away quickly to confirm what I most feared. In picking up the photo of Abraxas, I exposed the one underneath to view."
    S "Wow..."
    C "(Oh no, here comes the mockery. I'll never be able to meet Sibyl's gaze again!)"
    S "You look {b}so{/b} different with black hair! How old is this photo? Your hair must grow super fast!"
    C "H-Huh?"
    "Sibyl holds up the photo of me and my three friends decked out in the most embarrassing, all-black outfits we could possibly muster, each of us with pitch black hair to match."
    C "O-Oh, well... I've been trying to grow it out naturally but my hair is actually carefully bleached and re-dyed from about here down."
    "Sibyl reaches out unbidden to twirl my hair through her fingers and tease the ends. I know she's looking for any telltale breakage, but if there's anything I'm an expert with by now, it's hair dye."
    S "Really? It's still so strong and smooth. I can barely tell it's dyed."
    C "(Well, duh, most of it is my real hair! I didn't take all those hair growth supplements for nothing!)"
    "It's even more unbearably embarrassing than I could possibly have expected it to be but actually feels really nice to have her play it with too."
    C "(This is {b}not{/b} how I wanted to \"open my heart\", Dad!)"
    C "You don't think I'm weird, Sibyl? For being into all this freakish occult stuff?"
    "Sibyl laughs shortly at my question, not with malice, but apparently at how absurd it is — and probably also at whatever pitiful expression I have on my face."
    S "Of course not, Clover. We've all done goofy things, haven't we?"
    "A soft flush emerges on Sibyl's cheeks despite her apparent reluctance to elaborate what she is presently remembering to herself."
    S "Besides, you shouldn't be afraid to show who you are. You might meet people who share the same interests too."
    C "I understand what you're saying Sibyl, okay? But you have to {b}promise{/b} me you won't tell {b}anyone{/b} about this. I put all this stuff behind me for good when I started high school."
    "It's clear that Sibyl doesn't agree with my request but honors it anyway and motions once more to the photo."
    S "Are these your friends?"
    C "From middle school."
    S "Not anymore?"
    "The way I toss the photo aside should provide enough of an answer, but if I've already said this much a little more won't kill me."
    C "Not anymore. We all quit the goth stuff when we started high school and kind of went separate ways."
    "Two of my friends got boyfriends, the third made softball her {b}entire{/b} life, and I just stayed... me."
    S "I'm so sorry, Clover. You four of you look like you had a lot of fun together."
    "A quiver of a sob threatens to burst up through my chest but ultimately dies there before being born into the cruel world."
    "It's fully a surprise because I've long since written off all three of them from my life ever since we went our separate ways, but nostalgia, it seems, almost gets the best of me this time."
    C "We did. Honestly, it was... kind of hard, starting high school like that, with no friends, and no place to belong. And even when I got home, things were still kinda rough..."
    C "(Oh gosh, what am I {b}saying{/b}? I didn't mean to \"open my heart\" {b}this{/b} much! Make it stop!)"
    S "That's one of the reasons I wanted to come to Prudence Prep, Clover. The Vertu system ensures we're never alone and always have a supportive environment to fall back on when we need it."
    "It might not have been a big thing to Sibyl, but what she says leaves me dazed. All at once I realize what I fool I've been."
    C "(Of course... I'm such an idiot.)"
    "Not hearing me reply, Sibyl stops to look back at me in concern, whispering my name with uncertainty."
    S "Clover...?"
    C "(Mom, Dad, I'm so sorry.)"
    "For weeks I've felt that being sent here to the academy must be some kind of cruel punishment, if not just plain old abandonment. Now I realize just how wrong I have been all this time."
    C "(Being sent here was for {b}my{/b} benefit.)"
    "My parents surely miss me just as much as I miss them, but between my troubles fitting in at school and the complex home life caused by their divorce—"
    C "(They just wanted me to be happy. That's all they've ever wanted for me.)"
    "Tears start rolling down my cheeks thicker than a monsoon. Sibyl worriedly calls out my name again so I reach out to touch her arm and calm her concern."
    C "I'm sorry, I just... need a moment to process some things, like, in my head."
    S "Of course, Clover. Take all the time you need."
