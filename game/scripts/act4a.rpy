    "Saturday, the day of our first date, approaches too slowly for the amount of nerves that have been gradually building up inside me, but arrive at last it finally does."
    "Tanya and I go about our usual weekend routine starting with a long lacrosse team practice session."
    "My nerves are jumpy the whole practice but I manage to put up a good performance in our practice game anyway. Best of all, I don't think anyone even catches on that I'm anxious about something."
    C "(I don't really get what Tanya is so afraid of happening if anyone finds out we're going on a date, but if it makes her feel better I'll play along.)"

    "Tanya part ways from me and Sibyl after lunch as usual, but as the time for our rendezvous ticks closer, I still haven't found a good excuse for leaving Sibyl alone and running out on my mystery errand, so I just tell her truthfully."
    S "Why didn't you {b}tell{/b} me, Clover!"
    C "Tanya wanted it to be private between us... so don't tell her I told you. I'm sure it's nothing personally against you exactly."
    S "Okay, okay, I won't tell anyone, but before that, we need to do something about {b}you{/b}."
    C "{b}Me{/b}? What do you mean!?"
    "I try my best to persuade Sibyl that I'm perfectly fine the way I am, but she does not relent until I'm standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom while Sibyl buzzes around my hair and face with all kinds of products."
    "When I question Sibyl as to why she has all this stuff but never uses it, she reminds me that there are no boys at a girls' school."
    S "There you go! Tanya is going to drop dead on the spot when she sees you!"
    C "Can you not try to kill my girlfriend— erm, \"potential girlfriend\", before I've even had my first date with her?"
    "Though I might put up a minor fuss, I really do look incredible. Even while operating under the boundary that I not look too made-up, it's still incredible what Sibyl has pulled off."
    C "(It's amazing what a little lip gloss, hair serum, mascara— okay, maybe it is a bit much after all.)"
    "I'd never in the past worn anything of the sort that wasn't pitch black, and I still don't think I need to wear any of this stuff at all, but it would be a lie to say seeing myself so made up didn't boost my confidence."
    C "Thanks, Sibyl, you're the best."
    S "You're very welcome. Go get her, Clover!"

    "As I approach the dormitory lounge at the meeting time we have pre-arranged, I take in and exhale one final deep breath before the last plunge."
    T "There, you are, Clover. I was beginning to think you—"
    "Tanya is already waiting when I arrive. She walks right up when she notices me, but stops short in her greeting the moment she actually sees me."
    C "Is it... too much?"
    T "No, Clover, you look {b}gorgeous{/b}."
    "My confidence had faltered for a moment there, but hearing Tanya's words without even a hint of teasing boosts me even higher than before."
    T "Almost as gorgeous as you look while giving it your all on the lacrosse field."
    C "(Since when is {b}Tanya{/b} so dang sweet!?)"
    C "Thanks! But, umm... Sibyl did most of it for me."
    C "I know you said not to tell her about today, but not spending this time together is highly unusual. Are you sure it's okay for you to not go to your Saturday thing?"
    T "Yes, I'm sure."

    "Even as we start off toward our destination, Tanya is carefully looking around our surroundings like she's afraid we might be followed."
    C "Who are you so afraid might find out, Tanya? Vittoria and Vincenza?"
    T "Yeah, or worse... I don't want disruptions to our date."
    "The word \"date\" still gives me some warm fuzzy feelings when Tanya says it so casually. I let them flutter around my body and fizzle out before probing further."

    C "Those two have been trying to get us together like this for weeks, weren't they? Why would they try to stop it now?"
    T "They might not try to stop us, but they do have a knack for mischief, as do others. Forget I said anything about it, okay? We're almost there."
    "Our destination, I soon learn, is a particularly old tree at the far end of the grassy field which is adjacent to the chapel on the academy's grounds."
    C "(That's a {b}big{/b} tree...)"
    "When I saw that Tanya suggested climbing a tree, I thought it would be fun at the time, but now that I stand before it's huge, tall mass, I'm a bit more skeptical."
    C "You want me to climb tha!?"
    T "Not all the way up it! And look, it's so old that it has a bunch of low, easy to climb and sit on branches."
    "With seemingly no effort at all, Tanya scrambles right up the branches until her feet are already nearly at my chest height."
    C "I can't do that; I'm not a squirrel."
    T "I've watched you eat churros many times now, Clover. You are most definitely a squirrel."
    "Though she might be comparing me to a rodent, Tanya also reaches down to offer a hand to get me going."
    C "You're not going to make me \"accidentally\" fall to my death here, are you?"
    "I take her hand anyway, allowing her to guide me up the branches like stepping stones. It turns out to be way easier than it looks, just as she promised."
    T "Will you ever let that go?"
    C "Never!"
    T "If I really wanted to kill you, I could have taken any of the many opportunities before this one."
    "With how securely my hand is held within hers, there's no doubt that we'd both being tumbling down if either one of us were to take a tumble from the branches."
    "Tanya releases my hand when we do finally reach a branch she decides is good for sitting on. I find, with some surprise, that my grip is sweatier than I expected it to be."
    C "This... isn't too bad."
    T "I told you so."
    "We sit with our butts side by side on a particularly thick and sturdy horizontal branch. Our legs kick freely below us at such a meager height that we might accidentally kick the heads of any students who might pass underneath, if anyone came out this far."
    C "The view is really nice too."
    T "Isn't it?"
    "The place we sit partially surrounds us with leafy foliage, but a small clearing in the greenery provides a clearing enough to frame a view of the academy off in the distance across the open fields."
    "From our little perch up in the tree I spot the dormitory, school building, chapel, and the big stone statue peeking out above the flowering gardens."
    C "Is this, like, your \"secret hideaway\"?"
    "I'm only joking, but Tanya immediately confirms my question without even a second thought."
    T "Yeah, it is, so don't go telling anyone about it."
    C "(Tanya trusts me enough to show me her secret hideaway!?)"
    "The thought makes me a little giddy inside, but Tanya doesn't stop talking so I resume my attention to what she's saying while idly kicking my legs back and forth below me."
    C "So this is where you go every Saturday!?"
    T "What? No! This is where I go to be alone. If I don't get some peace from Sierra I might actually murder her for real."
    C "You're just joking, right?"
    C "(It's only our first date and she's already making plans to be locked away for life!)"
    T "Live with her for a week — no, a {b}day{/b} — and you might think otherwise."
    C "I won't let you murder her because then the really cool but kinda scary girl I want to make my girlfriend will go to prison, and I'll only be able to see her through bullet proof glass."
    T "I'm not going to murder anyone, Clover!"
    C "Well, there's still the conjugal visits at least!"
    "The rosy glow shining on Tanya's cheeks are proof that I've struck first, which is no small matter of pride to me, who flubbed courting Sibyl so badly before."
    C "(Score one for Clover! Tanya might be strong, but she doesn't know who she's up against!)"
    "Many hours of the past couple evenings which should have been devoted to homework were passed instead on search engines preparing for just this moment."
    C "(Surely, all those internet articles about how to make a good first date cannot ever lead me astray. It's time to make this girl mine!)"
    C "So, anyway..."

    T "Yes, way. Your hair shines like pure white gold in the sunlight and your eyes are a dusky moss-covered forest grove."
    C "Y-You too."
    T "What?"
    C "Nothing. Go on."
    T "How do you think you won Homecoming Queen so easily? Most of our classmates are too afraid to talk to you for fear of shattering the illusion of perfection."
    C "(They all voted for {b}you{/b}'cause you're so cool. {b}That's{/b} how we won the titles.)"
    "With how fast Tanya is chattering, my rebuttal never makes it out of my head."
    T "When we made a comprehensive ranking of who on campus we'd most like to fuck, you came in {b}second{/b} out of everyone else here!"
    # in case you're wondering, first was Izzie, because everyone in the cabal knows she'd blow their minds
    C "Who is the \"we\" that's making these weird lists—"
    C "Wait a minute, I came in {b}second{/b!? Who got first!?"
    T "{b}Now{/b} you believe what I'm saying?"
    T "Weren't you bullied by jealous girls in your old school? Like, for being prettier than them, or for stealing their boyfriends' attention? Isn't that why you're so afraid of everyone else?"
    "Tanya finally lets me cut in, but rather than be able to respond to all the stuff she was just spewing, I'm left astonished by what she says last."
    C "For being prettier? For having the attention of their boyfriends? {b}As if!{/b} I got bullied for being—"
    "I manage to shut myself up before revealing my \"dark\" — in multiple ways — past, but the damage is already done."
    T "For being...?"
    "I know I'm not going to be able to weasel out of this one against an opponent as strong as Tanya, so I take the second best route out of this."
    C "We're trying to be open and share things about ourselves with one another, right, Tanya?"
    "She nods, allowing me to continue. The vagueness of how I've asked and the lingering curiosity of what I was bullied for must be keeping her docile."
    C "I'll tell you... if you promise to tell me something about yourself that you've been hiding from me as well."
    "I know it's a big ask; I think I visibly see Tanya swallow when I say it. Ultimately, she agrees."
    T "I promise."
    C "Promise on something important, like... your lacrosse stick!"
    T "I promise on my lacrosse stick."
    C "Okay, okay, good! Now promise on..."
    T "{b}Clover!{/b}"
    C "Alright, alright! Well, you see... I was kind of in an \"occult goth\" phase for basically all of middle school."
    C "If I was ever being bullied, it was because of {b}that{/b}. Eventually, I learned how to fade into the background as a defense mechanism."
    "The sigh encapsulating four plus years of middle school angst escapes upward from deep down in the pit of my stomach before I can stifle it."
    C "That kind of {b}really{/b} messed me up, didn't it?"
    "The question is spoken to myself more than to Tanya, but even as I ask it aloud, I know that the good times I had with my fellow awkward goth friends will surely outweigh any of the bad."
    T "{b}You{/b} were a {b}goth{/b} girl!? I can't even picture it."
    "Tanya very nearly spins where she sits on the branch just to comprehensively look me over once more, as if there might still be a little bit of black dye still in my hair or something."
    C "I have the pictures to prove it, unfortunately. They really should be burned now that I think about it."
    T "You're not burning them before I see them."
    "It's not a question; It's a command. Tanya's eyes burn menacingly with interest in my direction."
    C "Nuh uh. Now you've got to tell me your embarrassing stories, and I want pictures of it as proof! If you don't hold up your end of the bargain, I'm going to throw you off this branch right now."
    T "Now who's threatening to murder who!?"
    "Tanya's only joking the same as I am, but the sternness of my expression surely shows I will not be giving up this opportunity to hold something over her."
    "Underneath the lighthearted banter, it's clear that Tanya is struggling to summon the courage for her own admission. I wait patiently, but not for long."
    T "I drew {i}baihe manhua{/i} in middle school."
    "I repeat the words \"baihe manhua\" in my head a few times, but all the phrase does is rattle around without knocking loose any nuggets of recognition in my brain."
    T "That's why I was interested in joining the arts club before I ever even met Sibyl, so you see, it has nothing to do with her."
    T "I may have stuck around because I had a tiny little crush on her, but that's beside the point and well in the past now."
    C "Wait, wait, stop. Back up. What is a \"bay hee mon wah\"?"
    T "Oh, sorry, it's like— Are you familiar with the term {i}manga{/i}?"
    C "Like {i}Sailor Milky{/i}?"
    T "You know about {i}Lovely Defender Sailor Milky{/i}?"
    C "That manga about Sailor Milky and her friends Sailor Andromeda, Sailor Triangulum, and Sailor Messier fighting the evil Queen Cadmium?"
    "How quickly I am able to recall the names of the characters is a welcome surprise, and proof enough that I do in fact have a perfectly functioning and downright capable brain after all."
    C "A friend I had in middle school practically begged me to read the first volume, but I never kept up with it after that."
    T "Oh."
    "The disappointment is obvious on Tanya's face, which makes me upset to have caused it in turn, though I do not know exactly why."
    C "I-Is that a \"bay hee mon wah\"?"
    T "No, not at all, but also, maybe a little similar. That one is Japanese, so it's a manga. When it's Chinese, it's a manhua."
    C "And what about the first part? The \"bay lee\"?"
    T "\"Baihe\". It means that it's about girls who like girls."
    C "Is it, like, porn?"
    T "It is {b}not{/b} porn!"
    "Why question is asked innocently enough, but Tanya's answer is so vigorous that I feel as though she might shake us both off the tree if she's not careful."
    C "Okay, I get it! Not porn!"
    C "(What makes this embarrassing exactly? Was it all really ugly amateur art?)"
    C "So you used to draw this stuff? Were you ever published?"
    T "Most manhua doesn't get sold as a physical book like manga, but I did self-publish online where I received a lot of likes and comments."
    C "What so embarrassing about this then? it sound to me like you're just bragging about your art skills and how popular you are! I feel ripped off!"
    T "Is it {b}so{/b} totally embarrassing, Clover! Art is an extension of your inner self, so publishing these works is like suddenly exposing the parts of you that no one sees to millions of people."
    C "I thought you said it {b}wasn't{/b} porn. What's the opposite of a \"voyeur\"?"
    T "Clover, I am {b}seriously{/b} going to strangle you to death right now."
    C "Nooo! I promise I won't tell anyone else about your porn books, so don't kill me please!"
    "I inch away from Tanya on the tree branch, but not fast enough as she easily captures my arm to carefully slide me right back beside her."
    T "I know it might be hard, but would you please {b}try{/b} to possess a functioning brain for a moment, Clover?"
    T "It's embarrassing because I poured all of my thoughts and feelings... my passions and desires... into my manhua."
    T "That I'm willing to show them to you... don't you understand what that means?"
    "The dark marbles of Tanya's eyes silently bore through me as she awaits my response, showing both indignation at my indifference but also pleading for me to reassure her that it wasn't a mistake to reveal this to me."
    C "(She hasn't even told Sibyl about this? So I know something about Tanya that even Sibyl doesn't know?)"
    "The answer comes to me easily, but I replay it over in my head a few times before I speak it aloud, just to make sure it sounds as smart and well-reasoned as Tanya is expecting."
    C "Just like I revealed my super shameful goth past that I don't want anyone to know about or even ever think about for the rest of my life, you're willing to share with me equally personal \"manhua\" that shows the sides of you that no one else sees."
    "My answer is evidently satisfactory to Tanya judging by the little sigh of relief she gives, though she does not release the grip on my arm quite yet."
    T "Thank you for understanding, Clover."
    C "You did say that you wanted to actually know the real me, so it only makes sense that you want me to know the real you too."
    T "Exactly. That's my whole goal for our date today."
    C "Is it normal to make goals for dates?"
    T "U-Umm—..."
    "My question unexpectedly throws Tanya for a loop. She stammers, then pauses, releasing my arm finally, to express herself more eloquently than she started."
    T "As long as we're being honest, you're the first person who has wanted to date me and who I felt I wanted to try to make it work with. Am I overthinking this too much?"
    C "Maybe a little, but I don't think you're wrong to want to take it slowly and carefully. I rushed too fast into my feelings for Sibyl and ended up hurting us both, so maybe setting a simple goal for our first date isn't such a bad thing at all?"
    T "Did you have a goal for our date, Clover?"
    "My blood pressure spikes such that my heart is pounding in my ears, or maybe it's because all the blood has drained out of my lower extremities and into my head."
    C "(Of course I set a goal!)"
    "After hearing all about Tanya's forthright plans to evaluate her and my feelings for one another, it's kind of hard to tell her what my goal was."
    "At the same time, not telling her and pretending I didn't have a goal at all would be dishonest and totally against the entire rationale of her goal, so I try to push down the anxiety creeping up my chest to be quite honest with Tanya."
    C "C-Can I... k-kiss you?"
    T "Clover..."
    C "Y-Yeah...?"
    "Tanya speaks my name so softly, drawing me in. I inch just a little closer, nearly rubbing my side against hers as I gaze into her eyes, so happy she didn't shut me down."
    T "You don't {b}ask{/b} for a kiss!"
    C "H-wha!?"
    T "You just {b}do it{/b} when the mood is good! {b}Idiot{/b}!"
    C "S-Shut up, Tanya!"
    T "Make me!"
    C "I {b}will{/b}!"
    "Like a foolhardy swimmer into a lake of piranhas, I grab Tanya by the arm and close the gap between us without any hesitation."
    "I brace myself for an awkward meeting of our faces, but rather than bump noses or bash foreheads, our lips come together so smoothly that it almost feels natural and welcomed by Tanya."
    C "(There's no way... She was yelling at me just a mere fraction of a second ago!)"
    "The kiss is sublime, like the kiss I shared with Sibyl but at least three and a five-eighths times better. Not only am I obviously way into it, but this time the girl whose lips I'm squishing against my own is very into it too."
    C "(Mission: accomplished.)"
    "We both pull back in an entirely natural conclusion of the simple kiss, but the distance between us remains small."
    "The world outside the gap of air between us might as well not exist. Smoldering glances flicker between our half-lidded eyes while little creeping touches tease against one another."
    "The atmosphere is so charged between us that our lips draw together magnetically once again in another instant."
    C "Hnf."
    T "Mmn."
    "Our first was clean. Pure. The second is less so."
    "There's a desire plainly in both of us, and though we do not quite get French about it, we're well on our way as neither wants to pull away despite sinking ever deeper into the kiss."
    "{b}Tanya and Clover, sittin' in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-{/b}"
    "Tanya and I both separate the instant we hear our names called from back by the campus buildings all the way across the field, followed by some ensuing commotion and many giggles."
    C "(Were we always this close?)"
    "My first surprise, before even looking in the direction of the sounds, is just how much the two of us had come together physically while we were kissing."
    "Our knees are pressed together, our legs practically entwined, and what little grip we weren't using to stay securely in the tree found their way to pawing at each other."
    "Naturally, this is the first thing to go when we're suddenly exposed, both jumping apart like we got caught with our hands in the cookie jar."
    T "I can't {b}believe{/b} they found me!"
    "When I do follow Tanya's eyes, I peer through the small clearing in the foliage that allows us to look back at the campus, to find a whole gaggle of bodies hiding around the corner of the chapel looking right back at us through the same gap."
    C "(Tanya's right. Those people would have to have been looking for us to notice us through such a small gap on the other side of the field.)"
    "I have to squint a little bit to make them out, but I can clearly make out Ms. Woolsey lifting the much smaller Miss Izzie, who appears to be flailing in protest, and carry her back behind the wall of the chapel."
    "There's a tall blonde woman I've never seen there too, as well as at least half a dozen or more other pink shapes that I recognize as our uniform."
    "I do manage to identify Vittoria and Vincenza before they and the rest of the students spying on us realize we have noticed them and also make their escape behind the chapel wall."
    T "Let's go, Clover."
    C "But we just got here!"
    "Even as I say it, I notice while looking back at the chapel again how much more aggressively angled the shadows have gotten since we first arrived."
    "The trip back down the tree turns out to be even harder than the journey up it, but I manage to return to Mother Earth in one piece with sufficient time and effort. Tanya hops down behind me like it's nothing."
    C "(Show off!)"

    "Sibyl's question trails out quietly as she glances between us, but she finishes again soon enough with an eerie grin and a lilt to her voice after another moment longer."
    S "...go?"
    "I glance at Tanya just as she does the same to me in a move similar to the twins, confirming that both of us think Sibyl is acting weird."

    T "Umm... No, thanks. I don't think it would really suit my image at all."

    S "I can hardly imagine it, Tanya."
    T "Y-Yeah... but as painful as it is to remember how I was back then, I don't want to forget it because it makes me proud to see the results of all my hard work at the gym to get where I am now."
    C "So that's how you got so strong!"
    T "I was really into dietary programs and strength training before I enrolled at Prudence Prep. There's no proper fitness center here so I mostly do calisthenics in addition to my training for lacrosse."

    "Tanya nods her assent, and glad to be off the topic of her traumatic middle school years, fiddles with her smartphone while Sibyl and I gather closely around either side so we can see her screen better."
    T "S-So... this is the last manhua I worked on. It's probably the best, or at least, it's the one which was made when my art skills were the best."

    "Past the title page, Tanya scrolls down to the first panel where we get a frame of the protagonist, who I presume to be a Chinese girl by her name and short, jet black hair."
    S "She's cute!"
    "I have to agree with Sibyl, and I do so aloud so that Tanya can hear it, as well as complement her artistic skills which are of course way above mine."
    C "So it's not a book? It's all this really long scrolly thing?"
    T "Yes. This is how most digital manhua is arranged."
    C "Is all the big white spaces between the frames is like a new page or something?"
    "Tanya continues scrolling through the first chapter, narrating text where necessary, though it is fairly easy to follow since it's just an introduction of the main character."
    "Qiuyue is a normal girl just starting out a new year at school. As she's getting dressed in the morning the day of the entrance ceremony, she pinches her chubby stomach with displeasure and swears to one day be skinny like a model."
    T "—And here's Clara. She's, umm, well, I did warn you that this was a baihe manhua, right?"
    "Clara is pretty foreign transfer student with wavy blonde hair and sapphire blue eyes. The frame when she first enters makes it quite clear that everyone, Qiuyue included, thinks she's just about the most beautiful person ever."
    C "(Maybe Sibyl can do my hair that way too?)"
    S "Wow, she's all over her, huh?"
    T "Clara? Yeah, it's basically love at first sight for her. Qiuyue is {b}exactly{/b} her type."
    "The blonde foreign student shown immediate infatuation with the protagonist, to the point of getting way too close for strangers at her desk in front of the whole class."
    C "(Tanya really went all out with drawing those \"beauty sparkles\" around her!)"
    "As Tanya continues through the first chapter, it becomes clear why. Clara, a celebrity model from Norway is in China for a short term artistic residency, and is on a strict diet to keep her impossibly slim figure."
    "But, as Clara is quick to explain while following Qiuyue to where she intends to eat her lunch alone, she really loves soft chubby girls, and wants to feed Qiuyue all the foods she wishes she could eat."
    T "The main story of the work is how Qiuyue desperately wants to slim down while Clara conversely keeps pushing food on her."
    S "But, like, they're also lesbians?"
    "That much should be clear, I think, from the way Clara is shown squeezing Qiuyue's chubby thighs way too high up what is already a dizzyingly short skirt."
    T "Oh, yeah, they kiss and stuff later, but you probably don't want to see it."
    "Tanya quickly squeezes the side button of her smartphone to darken the screen as we finish the first chapter like she doesn't intend to go on to the second."
    S "I want to see it, Tanya! I've never seen you make any kind of artwork like this before."
    T "Even if there's a lot of kissing and other stuff?"
    S "I'm {b}fourteen years old{/b}, Tanya. I think I'll be fine seeing a drawing of cartoon characters kissing."
    T "R-Right..."
    "Tanya certainly doesn't look very sure at all about showing Sibyl more of {i}Heavy Love{/i}, but she gives in almost instantly when Sibyl pressures her for more."
    S "{b}After{/b} a quick break! Wait for me, please!"
    "Sibyl dashes off to the adjoining bathroom, leaving Tanya alone with me in a way that suddenly feels kind of awkward. Wanting to ease the mood, I dredge up something to break the silence."
    C "So... is Sibyl going to be okay with the \"other stuff\" in the later chapters?"
    "For just a moment, Tanya stares blankly at me with her mouth half open, obviously unsure how to answer my question."
    T "She might not even realize what's happening...?"
    C "So they do \"that stuff\" with each other!?"
    T "They do it {b}a lot{/b} in later chapters. We might not even get that far tugh."
    C "They do it, {b}a lot{/b}!?"
    T "I needed an outlet for my own frustrations, okay?"
    "With some amusement do I realize exactly what Tanya means while she's so aggressively defending her artistic work."
    T "But because of the weird rules about publishing this kind of thing in China and Singapore, it's not graphic at all and actually drawn very... metaphorically."
    C "Metaphorically?"
    T "Can we just drop it for now? I want to hear more about what you were like as a goth."
    "Like she's desperate to drop the conversation, Tanya quickly reaches for my box and digs around to pull out something random from within it to ask me about."
    T "What's this?"
    "Luckily for her, I am willing to wait until it's my turn to get her to show me whatever smutty stuff she drew in middle school."
    C "That's my ouija board!"
    T "What do you... do with it?"
    C "It lets you communicate with spirits of the dead. Here, I'll show you!"
    T "Thanks, but no. I don't need to hear my ancestors asking me why I haven't been married yet."
    C "That's never happened to me before."
    T "{b}You're{/b} not Chinese."
    C "I thought you {b}wanted{/b} to know what I was like in middle school?"
    "Tanya's resistance falls away quickly after I hit her with that unfair one liner, and the two of us sit on either side of the board from one another."
    "With our hands together on either side of the board and our heads turned down with respect for the dead, I start us off."
    C "Spirits near and far: the most kind and gentle among ye, we humbly solicit to speak."
    "After raising our heads, we release each others' hands only to each place one upon the planchette atop the board."
    C "So all we have to do is ask questions and the spirits will answer!"
    T "With the board?"
    C "Yeah, the planchette will move letter by letter to reveal the spirit's answer."
    T "Uhh, okay... you start."
    "Putting on a bit of a theatrical voice, I ask of the first spirit to speak to us."
    C "Come, gentle soul, and tell us your name!"
    "Both Tanya and I watch intensely at the planchette under our fingers as it begins to drift slightly between us."
    T "R... A... L... C... O..."
    C "Carol! Your name is Carol!"
    T "What?"
    C "R - A - L - C - O... It's an anagram!"
    T "The spirit is dyslexic?"
    "If I were back in middle school, I would totally be annoyed by how little Tanya \"gets\" the appeal of the ouija board, but now I only think her dry disbelief is amusing and totally \"Tanya\"."
    C "Now you try, Tanya. Ask her a question!"
    T "What should I ask her?"
    C "Just think of something easy."
    T "Oh, Spirit, tell us your favorite color!"
    "After Tanya asks the question aloud, we both concentrate on the planchette again, which moves once more to answer our questions."
    C "R... E... D... E..."
    C "Wait, you must mean \"red\"!"
    "I grin across to Tanya, but I can tell by the blank expression returned that I'm quickly losing her interest."
    C "(Give me a little helping hand here, \"Carol\"!)"
    C "I call upon ye, red-favored spirit of Carol, what must I do to to make Tanya a believer?"
    "This time, I help \"Carol\" along a little bit with a bit of subtle pushing."
    C "K... I... S..."
    C "I wonder what she's trying to say?"
    C "S... M... E..."
    "With an artificial gasp, I quickly look up to Tanya while continuing to play up the spooky encounter."
    C "What she's telling us... should we do it!?"
    T "\"KISS MEN\"? I {b}told{/b} you this would happen!"
    C "Huh?"
    "Looking back down to the board, the tricksy Carol must not like me interfering in her answer at all and played a trick on me by moving it again toward the \"N\"."
    C "No, no, she's not finished, see?"
    "Quickly, I nudge the planchette against toward the \"O\" and \"W\"."
    C "She says, \"KISS ME NOW\"! She wants to you to kiss me!"
    "From where my fingers rest next to Tanya's on the planchette, I crawl them up her fingers and onto her hand as I lean close to her over the ouija board."
    T "It sounds more like the spirit wants me to kiss \"her\", not \"you\"."
    "Much to my pleasure, Tanya doesn't dwell on \"Carol's\" choice of words and instead happily meets my smooch. The plush meeting of our lips makes me feel just as electric and tingly as before."
    "Before I know it, I've become fully enraptured and fall ever deeper into Tanya."
    "The kiss never breaks but only gets more intense. I don't know exactly which of us starts it, but one second we're just smooching and the next we're full-on making out."
    "Without even opening my eyes, I carelessly brush aside the ouija board between us so that I can get even closer to Tanya, gripping her arm on one side, and bracing myself against her shoulder on the other."
    T "C-Clover..."
    "Hearing my name brush off Tanya's lips only stokes my fire to even greater intensity. A swift shift in equilibrium carries me fully horizontal without making any conscious effort to do so."
    "I think, with some small part of my mind not currently crammed full of Tanya, that it must have knocked her over with how far over the board when I was leaning into her."
    C "Mng, Ta... nya!"
    "My heart feels like's it's going to burst out of my chest with very passing moment."
    "I feel as though I might even faint, though that could be due to my paltry oxygen intake and not the way Tanya's chest brushes against mine or the way our legs entwine together to the detriment of how carefully I mad my sheets that morning."

    H "There's a {b}huge{/b} spider right next to me. {i}Odio i ragni{/i}! Kill it!"
    mw "I am hearing some voices over there, but they don't sound very {b}regal{/b} to me!"
    "The softly chiding voice of Ms. Woolsey sounds out from the other side of the garden, and I realize in the moment that, while they retain their outward personas for their audience at the windows, it doesn't extend past their faces."
    "That Vittoria is distressed enough to slip in and out of Italian is odd enough, but then I note Vincenza start blinking at me rapidly, and after a few confusing moments, realize she's probably trying to spell out \"S-O-S\" with her eyelids."
    C "What is going on here?"
    O "Ms. Woolsey tricked us!"
    H "She said she was going to teach us how to arrange flowers like proper {i}ojou-sama{/i}!"
    "The devil inside me wishes to tease them and keep them sweating, literally, but before I can make a plan for what I'm going to do now that I have them at my mercy, Ms. Woolsey walks over to hand them both a bottle of water dripping with condensation."
    mw "Gardening is an important part of any {i}ojou-sama{/i} curriculum! It just so happens that the gardener called out sick and I was free to teach you both all about it."
    "The twins take big gulps, trying all the while not to look too eager so as not to blow their well-crafted cover personas."
    mw "As it is, neither of you could discern an aster from an azalea!"
    H "No flower is more important to know than the exalted lily."
    O "And we do already know about flowers, that one aside!"
    mw "Oh yeah? What's this one?"
    "Ms. Woolsey points to a cluster of bright orange and yellow flowers in the next row over. The twins look at them but return no answer."
    mw "That is a daylily."
    H "{b}That{/b} is a lily?"
    O "But it is orange!"
    mw "It is in fact not a true \"lily\" at all. It's in a completely different genus and family."
    C "So what you mean is, Ms. Woolsey, that it only {b}looks{/b} like one thing, but is actually something entirely different past the superficial resemblance?"
    mw "Exactly!"
    C "So just like \"Prince\" Vincenza and \"Princess\" Vittoria?"
    mw "Very clever, Clover!"
    "I soak up the pride of being called \"clever\" for once. It's been a decidedly rare compliment ever since I met Tanya."
    "Our teacher soon returns to her work, leaving me instead to my fate of the payback I will no doubt receive from the twins."
    H "Laugh all you want, Clover, but watch {b}this{/b}!"
    "In as much of a flashy fashion as usual, Vittoria lifts a hand to tug softly upon her collar under her chin, while her other hand waves a gardening glove at her face like a fan and her head tilts backward."
    "I don't understand exactly what it is I'm supposed to be seeing, until motion catches the corner of my eye and I spot the general state of excitement present on the other side of the window panes just across the way."
    C "Huh..."
    H "\"Huh\"!? Is that all my fanservice does to you? How disappointing."
    O "Step aside, sister, and watch {i}Ouiji-kun{/i}\" in action!"
    "Now wanting to take her crack at it, Vincenza kicks one foot onto her shovel and leans her head aside, resting the cool condensation adorning the side of her water bottle against the heated flesh of the side of her neck."
    "I sneak another glance toward the windows, and though I cannot hear anything from the other side, half of the assembled onlookers appear to be screeching while the other half are so close to the glass that they're fogging it up."
    C "Wow, they really liked that one."
    H "This is not a fair match, sister. Their heterosexuality always wins out."
    C "But they're practically slobbering over her, and you're both definitely girls."
    H "{b}Prison gay{/b}, Clover."
    O "They play at love because they see me as the closest thing to a boy on campus. They keep their distance because they know the truth."
    C "You mean—"
    H "Their fantasies are safe at a distance. Any closer and they'd find out just how gay they {b}aren't{/b} when the panties drop."
    C "(That's so dumb! Either like Vittoria and Vincenza for what they are, or don't!)"
    "I'm legitimately annoyed for a hot minute, but then realize that I've been plenty horny myself since I've been locked away here at the academy, and was fortunate enough to have a suitable outlet for it."
    C "(How does Sibyl cope with her sexuality? I {b}know{/b} she doesn't like girls, and I've never seen her doing this \"playing at love\" thing before.)"
    "My ponderous thoughts remain unanswered for the time being, as the twins subtly re-position themselves facing away from the windows so they can speak more in depth without having to maintain as strict an outward composure."
    H "Speaking of dropping panties, how are things going with Tanya?"
    C "If you're asking if we've... had sex, that's none of your business."
    O "Excuse Vittoria's manner of asking. We have no ill intentions to be asking. Tanya is our friend, and so are you."
    "I'm understandably a little on guard with Vittoria and Vincenza, but try to let the tension dissipate since they do seem to be asking earnestly."
    C "Good, I think."
    O "You think?"
    C "We see each every day for practice in the morning morning, go to classes, eat meals, and do homework... but we don't really do any {b}girlfriend{/b} stuff."
    C "It's hard to make time for just the two of us, even with Sibyl being so supportive. We talked about planning a date for this Monday but haven't been able to come up with what to do."
    H "Have you considered the aquarium?"
    C "I don't think Tanya likes the aquarium very much, and besides, there won't be very much privacy there at all."
    C "We've both been all over every inch of this place. It feels like there's nowhere two people who aren't Vertu partners can be alone together."
    O "You'd be surprised."
    C "If you have a suggestion, spit it out!"
    H "Well, we can't give all of our secrets away, but there is one thing... do you know the student lounge?"
    "The twins turn to look at one another. Vittoria transmits her thoughts telepathically to her sister until she understands exactly what she's thinking."
    O "It is far enough from the upper bedroom floors that a pair of quiet girls might go unnoticed."
    C "The whole school has the day off. There'll be tons of people there, right?"
    O "Not if you go at an unpopular time."
    "The twins wait for me to catch up to what they're thinking, but all I see in their eyes is my own confused reflection."
    H "...Ms. Woolsey does her last rounds an hour before midnight."
    C "Are you telling me to break curfew?"
    O "Would the president of the student council encourage a student in her care to break curfew, Vittoria?"
    H "Certainly not, Vincenza. That would be quite the — what's the expression? — \"dereliction of duty\"!"
    "That the twins fall into their casual back-and-forth play is probably a sign of their revived spirits upon being properly hydrated."
    "I don't particularly want to break any school rules out of fear that any punishments for getting caught might affect our ability to play in upcoming lacrosse games."
    "On the other hand, it is true that the twin' suggestion would provide me and Tanya with both a place to be together comfortably and also the solitude we desire."
    C "(Plus, Ms. Woolsey wouldn't really put her two best midfielders on probation, would she?)"
    "With few other options and the calendar now hanging over my head, any option is worth exploring."

    T "Lacrosse is more about finesse than pure strength. You'll score more goals by perfecting the ability to shoot exactly where you want the ball to go than you will from lobbing fast and heavy shots blindly at the net."
    "When Sibyl asked us to teach her how to play lacrosse properly, we were both happy to do so."
    "I volunteered to mind the goal so that Tanya could instruct Sibyl on proper crosse handling, but was before I found out how terrifying Sibyl can be with a crosse in hand."
    C "(You tell her, Tanya! Oh no, here she comes again!)"
    "Tanya finishes her latest round of instructions, then Sibyl advances on me with a ball held high in her crosse with both hands like a samurai moving in to slice up the bad guy at the end of a samurai movie."
    S "Hyahh!"
    "Her gaze steels upon me with determination, and she again whips the ball so hard at me that she stumbles through the after-swing by sheer momentum alone."

    S "Clover, I'm so sorry, are you alright!?"
    C "Yeah, I'm fine. I didn't need them anyway."
    "I don't know actually where she hit me besides that it was below my waist, and that there's already a black and blue mark forming when I lift up my Wild Roses uniform to check out the damage."
    S "W-We should go see the nurse..."
    C "No, no, I'm fine, really, see? It's basically gone already!"
    "I stand up tall for Sibyl to put her back at ease, and it's not just for show. The pain really is starting to fade already."
    C "(Tanya and I both know the goaltenders normally wear pads, but I don't think either of us expected Sibyl to be able to shoot the ball this forcefully.)"
    C "Maybe Tanya could take a turn goalkeeping?"
    T "Didn't you just say that you are already over it?"
    "I shoot Tanya an evil glare when Sibyl leans in to look closer at my bruise. She sure doesn't seem all that concerned about my injury for someone who is supposed to be dating me."
    T "Besides, one of us has to keep her ovaries in working condition if we're going to have children some day."
    "It's obviously just a joke — that much is written on Tanya's face — but I think I feel a very real twitch in my bruised ovaries as she says it."
    C "(Calm down, you two. We went on {b}one{/b} date.)"
    "Still, noticing that I've honestly just about had enough with goalkeeping, Tanya draws Sibyl back away from the net with the promise of moving on to working on her passing skills."
    T "Shooting the ball is important to score points and win games, of course, but as midfielders what Clover and I do most is passing the ball up the field from the defensive team to the offensive team."
    C "Tanya's right; passing is the most important skill in the game."
    "Happy to escape the net, I join Sibyl at Tanya's side while the latter explains the finer points of passing with the crosse sticks that Ms. Woolsey did not cover in our short time playing lacrosse for gym class."
    "Tanya and I demonstrate a simple back and forth running pass, just like we practice every morning together, except slower and with a lot more talking this time so that Sibyl catches all of the little things we're doing."
    "Sibyl remains pumped to give it a try herself, but deflates when she cannot manage to grab a single pass whatsoever."
    S "It looks so easy when I watch you both do it every morning."
    "She assures us that she doesn't actually think it's easy and understands that our skills come from all the practice hours we put in every day, but still is disheartened by her lack of ability nonetheless."
    "Sibyl hasn't come to our morning training sessions very often lately. My only guess as to why is that she doesn't feel like she has to be present to keep her friends from each others' throats anymore."
    C "(Now we're at each other's throat in an entirely different way.)"
    T "Let's start with standing passes and work up to jogging passes."
    "Static passing back and forth in a triangle with me and Tanya goes much better for Sibyl, but when we try to add a dynamic motion to it, she starts falling apart all over again."
    "Eventually, she just calls it quits and retreats to catch her breath on the gymnasium bleachers."
    S "I don't know how anyone can keep it up for sixty minutes straight."
    C "Most of the team does not play the entire game."
    T "And some of us are just stronger than others."
    "Smirking my way the entire time she says it, I reward Tanya's playful insolence with a shove that looks strong enough to send her tumbling over the bleachers but in reality barely registers as a wobble."
    S "How many more games do the Wild Roses play before the end of the Spring season?"
    "The innocent question from Sibyl cuts dead my good mood, though I try not to show it. I'd mostly been trying to ignore that fact that there are a finite number of games left in the season."
    T "Three more. Two away and one home."
    C "Is that all!?"
    "The exclamation was not meant to ever make it out of my brain, but make out of my brain it does, and all the way past my larynx too."
    S "Can you remember when Clover was so dead set against playing lacrosse?"
    T "I try not to."
    C "I just can't believe the season has passed so quickly."
    "My friends banter at my expense. It's lighthearted only, but plays at real doubts I have in the back of my mind."
    S "There's no way you'll miss the starting roster next year, Clover."
    T "Yeah, Ms. Woolsey would be crazy to not start you in the midfielder next season. Your skills have grown so much since placement."
    "That I'd place on the starting roster next season is without a doubt in my mind. It is the uncertainty of whether I'll be here at the academy next year at all that darkens my outlook."

    C "Hey, Tanya, do you want to...?"
    T "...Cuddle?"
    "It makes my heart leap to find that Tanya's thoughts are exactly in sync with mine on the matter, and that she wants to be close to me as much as I do her."
    "There's a good ten minutes where both of us shuffle this way and that atop the sofa. At first Tanya sits up then I try to sit in front of her, but I just slide right off the front of the sofa."
    "Our second try involves me lying long ways and Tanya lying long ways beside me, but we both end up falling off. We swap spoon positions and body orientations again and again until we finally find a way to make it work satisfactorily."
    C "(Now this is more like it! I'm so glad I was able to stay awake.)"
    "It's incredibly cozy lying the way I eventually find myself, with my back against Tanya's warm chest while she also lies long ways perpendicular to the arm rest."
    "Her arms wrap around my front naturally, enclosing around me above similarly to her legs below. I'd probably fall asleep instantly in such comfort if my heart weren't pounding so forcefully."
    "It's not just my heart beating like crazy. I can hear Tanya's going crazy too."
    "With Tanya's smartphone propped up on the top ledge of the sofa, we click play and resume the movie where we left off. As before, now again do I find myself focusing little on the movie and more on Tanya surrounding me."
    "I try my absolute hardest to not be a freak about it, but I just cannot resist touching Tanya's arms around me. It's just a little brush of my fingers against her forearm at first, but soon enough the allure of her biceps does me in."
    C "(How did she get so strong!?)"
    "Tanya doesn't say anything at all when I pinch the muscles in her arms up and down her biceps, nor when I switch to pinching the firm muscles in her thighs beside me."
    "I'm not alone in letting my hands roam. When I switch again to feeling the firm, smooth expanse of Tanya's strong legs, she moves her hands up to run her fingers through my flowing hair."
    C "That feels really nice."
    "Tanya doesn't reply to my soft, nearly inaudible whisper. She merely continues drawing my hair into groups of strands, loosely braiding them together, then releasing the braid only to start all over again."
    "I don't think either of us are actually watching the movie. I certainly am not."
    T "Are my arms and legs really that interesting?"

    "Several moments pass where the only sound is the quiet chatter of the movie playing nearby before I reply in my own soft whisper."
    C "I like touching you."
    "I can tell Tanya likes touching me too without her saying it. She shows no signs of ceasing the gentle tug of my hair while she braids it, and it feels so good that I don't want her stop either."

    T "Clover?"
    C "Two people dating would mean they're girlfriends."
    T "Yeah."

    "I hate to ruin a moment as good as we had going, but Tanya and I don't always get to talk this honestly and sincerely with one another without breaking into a flirtatious battle of words or gestures."

    C "Is that what you think of \"us\"!? Are my feelings— just a statistic to you!?"

    T "N-No, Clover, but...?"
    C "But {b}what{/b}!?"
    C "(Ms. Woolsey is still with her high school girlfriend, isn't she? It's not fair to give up because of something so stupid!)"
    T "I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, Clover. It's all just my... insecurity getting the better of me."
    "My anger softens. There's no doubt in my mind that Tanya's backpedaling is not just for show. I've felt too much genuine passion and desire from her to believe she might never have really thought that much of me at all."
    T "I \"like\" you, a lot. Maybe {b}too{/b} much. That is how I feel about you, truthfully."
    "As much as I like the brash and confident Tanya, I like her just as much when she's being as vulnerable and cute as she is now."
    "My resistance to letting my arms go slack and kissing her right on the lips never materializes. I silence her lips with my own even though I'm nowhere near done interrogating her yet. I just need to kiss her right now before I go on."
    C "What are you so insecure about anyway? You know I \"like\" you. You know you \"like\" me. It's mutual."
    "Even in the darkness, I can see how sour my questioning is to her after coming off such a sweet shared kiss."
    T "You won't make fun of me if I tell you?"
    C "Not unless it's something really dumb, like that high school romance statistic you dropped on me."
    "My first round of assurances are not enough for Tanya, who makes me promise unconditionally to hear her out. I know these are her most sincere feelings, and I want to hear them, so I give in without a fight."
    T "I'm concerned about how our relationship can last because I don't know what it's {b}built{/b} on. Like, what is the {b}foundation{/b} of our feelings keeping us together?"
    C "We're human beings, Tanya, not buildings."
    T "It's a metaphor, Clover."
    T "Remember the manhua I showed you before? I used to read a lot of that, and in every one the characters have these big, meaningful {b}reasons{/b} for harboring their feeling."
    T "There's always a shining moment where they just know they're meant to be together forever — some big romantic gesture, or a dramatic confession, or like fate itself made them for each other."
    C "So what?"
    T "We don't have anything like that, do we? We fight all the time, and... I'm afraid that I only like you because you're super hot and totally my type."
    C "For how often you call me stupid, you should really take a good look in the mirror at the complete and utter {b}imbecile{/b} that you're making of yourself right now."
    "Tanya's face scrunches up all angry-like, no doubt because I'm insulting her for all of her insecurities that she so openly shared with me, but I don't stop there."
    C "We don't need any \"shining moments\" or \"fated encounters\", Tanya. So {b}what{/b} if you think I'm hot? I think {b}you're{/b} hot!"
    C "There doesn't have to be a reason for us to be together. All that matters is that you want to be here by my side, and that I want you to be here with me too."
    T "That's probably the smartest thing you've ever said, Clover."
    C "Try to remember it next time I say something really dumb, okay?"
    T "I'll keep it fresh in my mind for tomorrow."
    "All the hard feelings fade from Tanya's face as she listens to me, and in return for my surprise kiss earlier, she cranes her neck up to give me the same affection I showed to her earlier."
    T "You know how crazy sexy you are, Clover?"
    C "That's what you and Vittoria keep saying, but I don't know if I really believe it."
    T "Believe it."
    "The deep brown of Tanya's eyes smolder into my face half-lidded, while her hands roam from my shoulders, across my chest, past my waist, and finally hook behind my body low upon my back to pull me further atop her."
    "My suddenly very amorous girlfriend's strong lacrosse arms pull me down tightly into a kiss like no other that has probably ever been seen at such a dignified academy. She might be crushing me if I weren't giving in so easily."
    "Jitters stronger than any sugar rush I've ever had before flood through my body. The feeling of her fingers gripping into the uniform around my back alone makes me quiver in my necktie; such in the strength of the desire I feel from Tanya."
    "Being on top feels amazing, even if it's Tanya's keeping me held close and not me pushing her down. Her hold is so firm that I have to squeeze my hands up between the tangled mess of our hair to separate us ever so slightly, just so I don't suffocate."
    C "Nng!"
    "A heavenly sound vibrates from Tanya's throat and through my ears to echo in my brain, louder than even the sounds of our sloppy kissing reverberating in my skull."
    "My brain quickly connects the sound to the motion of my hand accidentally brushing over her chest."
    C "What the {b}heck{/b} was that? That was so {b}sexy{/b}!"
    "A powerful desire to hear more of those cute sounds pour out of Tanya's lips suddenly washes over me, like the hot sun rising over the desert. Tanya's firm, athletic body are the sands, and I the sun."
    "Again do I pass my palm over her chest, intentionally, and find her flesh respond immediately, as does her throat. Her small moans and pleasured exhales spur me only further, wanting to pass her chest and spread my warmth even lower."
    T "Mnn! Clover, wait, Clover!"
    "Tanya frantically removes her arms from around my back and snatches at my hand just as it washes over Tanya's quivering stomach."
    C "W-What!?"
    "I blink down at Tanya who pushes me up and away by my shoulder with one arm like it's entirely effortless, but I'm too focused on the rosiness of her heated cheeks to think too much of her strength."
    T "Today... isn't good for me."
    C "You mean...?"
    T "Yeah, so no sex. Is that alright...?"
    "I hadn't even intended to be reaching that low just yet, but clearly Tanya was concerned that I might get there enough to stop what we were doing cold."
    C "Y-Yeah..."
    C "(I think I've heard that you have to wait for the third date to have sex anyway...? This is the second, or, like, two and a half-th?)"
    T "Are you disappointed?"
    C "No, I can wait."
    "My answer maybe doesn't sound so sincere, because Tanya glances silently up at me in the darkness for several moments."
    "I honestly mean what I say when I tell her that I don't need to be that physical with her right now. The uncertainty that tinges my reply only comes from the knowledge that our time remaining at the academy is limited."
    C "(There might not ever be another moment like this.)"
    T "Come here..."
    "Tanya's arms once again pull me into a great big embrace, but this time she pulls my head across her shoulder to tenderly enclose my body against her own."
    "Her hand brushes through my hair down my back in long, slow motions, while the sound of her now calmed breathing rises and falls against my side where we lay together."
    "For the longest time, we both lie upon on another, our bodies pressed closely such that I can feel Tanya's heart pounding even through our uniforms."

    "I far too quickly get immersed in Tanya's cozy embrace, even falling asleep for a few moments, though I deny it when she shakes me awake."
    "There's no way I want to fall asleep anyway, not when we're both drawn into so passionate of a hugging session."
    C "(I never knew that hugs could feel so good.)"
    "With the night wearing on and a full day of classwork tomorrow, we eventually bring the date to an end."
    "Tanya's phone is fished out from between the cushions of the sofa where it had fallen unnoticed, and we make our way stealthily back into the darkened hallway once more."

    "We kiss good night once more at Tanya's door. Sierra, it seems, is a heavy sleeper and doesn't budge an inch even when her door squeaks open frighteningly loudly."

    "I slip into my own bed just as discreetly, being much more careful not to wake Sibyl who is sleeping in a different position than she was when I left earlier in the night."
    "My brain shuts off immediately when my head hits the pillow. Once my eyes close, I drift off into a deeply satisfying sleep that remains undisturbed by any dreams."
