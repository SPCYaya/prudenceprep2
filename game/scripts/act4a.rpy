    "I turn away from the windows before I catch and glimpses of further bad omens, just to be safe."
    C "(She's probably just embarrassed to be seen after what happened yesterday. Yeah.)"
    "Thankfully, I see Tanya come walking down the hallway towards me soon enough, though easily over 20 minutes later than our usual meeting time. I run right up to her without delay."
    C "You're {b}late{/b}, Tanya! Is everything okay!?"

    T "Good morning."
    C "(What. Was. {b}That?{/b})"
    "Grabbing Tanya's shoulders, I shake her about a little just to be sure the image before me is real and corporeal."
    C "Where is the {b}real{/b} Tanya!? What have you done with her, skinwalker!?"
    "I feel around \"Tanya\"'s bewildered face for any seams or telltale signs that the Tanya I know has been replaced with this absurdly cute creature, but find only her flawless skin well-attached to her correctly-oriented skull."

    C "(Whoa, false alarm! It's the real Tanya after all!)"
    C "Sorry, it's just... the birds were all flying left to right and you didn't show up on time..."

    C "No the kiss wasn't— Just forget I said anything about birds."
    C "Your kiss was nice, but, umm... unexpected. I wasn't ready for it."
    T "Are you... ready for it {b}now{/b}?"
    "I nod silently, and after a quick glance down the hallway to be sure no one is looking, we share another quick kiss that I can actually appreciate this time."
    C "(Who new a casual \"good morning\" kiss could be so electrifying?)"
    C "So... why were you late this morning anyway?"
    T "I, uhh, went to the chapel to offer thanks to God."
    C "You did!? What for!?"
    T "I recently realized that God has been using this extremely irritating but super hot girl to test my resolve, and that getting to make out with her recently must be my reward for putting up with all her bullshit."

    "Tanya's displeasure at seeing Vittoria is clear. Just as I'm wondering where Vincenza might be, the sound of the door closing firmly shut behind us rings out, followed by her voice coming up behind Tanya."
    O "Did you think you could give us the slip that easily?"
    T "How did you even get in here? This locker room is only for sports club members."
    H "We have our ways..."
    O "More importantly, why didn't you {b}tell{/b} us you were going out with Clover?"

    C "(Is this {b}bullying{/b}? I thought they were friends!)"
    T "It's none of your business, Vincenza, or yours, Vittoria."

    H "We're only having a little fun when we do it."
    O "It's different when you have real feelings."
    H "You {b}do{/b} have real feelings for her, right?"
    "Perhaps catching on to what the twins are saying, I offer up myself as bait to take the heat off of Tanya, even if it means having the pressure placed back on me."
    C "I-I was the one who wanted to kiss, so stop being so mean to Tanya!"
    O "{b}Clover{/b} initiated it?"
    T "You can't honestly blame me. When a girl {b}that{/b} beautiful {b}asks{/b} for it, how could I possibly refuse her?"
    "The twins both glance my direction with a knowing smile, but thankfully do not say anything more to Tanya about what happened that day after Sibyl rejected me."
    H "Truly, it is impossible."
    O "We understand completely."
    C "Okay, so maybe I'm not ugly or anything, but I'm not really {b}that{/b} gorgeous, am I?"
    "All three of the girls in front of me exchange glances in complete silence, completely unable to meet my questioning scan of their faces."
    C "Are you saying all I have to do is flirt a {b}little bit{/b} and you'll all do {b}anything{/b} I ask?"
    T "...Maybe not {b}anything{/b}."
    "Tanya might be trying to downplay this new revelation, but the twins are less circumspect."
    H "Heavens forgive us."
    O "We've created a monster."
    "The twins quit circling Tanya and assume their standard posture side-by-side one another in a more casual stance. They even apologize to Tanya for assuming that she had been keeping them in the dark about an ongoing relationship between me and her."
    T "I wanted our relationship to develop at our own pace — {b}without{/b} any outside interference. We would have told you when the time was right."
    C "See!? Tanya had good reason not to have told you about our first date beforehand!"
    H "Did you really expect us to interfere with your date?"
    O "After how much we've been trying to push you toward one another?"
    T "You {b}did{/b} interfere with our date, didn't you?"
    "There's a certain sharpness to her accusation, clearly demonstrating how Tanya is still bothered by what happened while we were kissing on the tree limb."
    O "You never showed up to the meeting. We were honestly just trying to find out what happened to you."
    O "The Grand Macaron said we should give you both privacy when we did finally find you and Clover."
    C "Who?"
    "The twins, and most annoyingly, Tanya as well, just keep right on ignoring me. I don't try very hard to force myself into the conversation while I think this is all still part of their apologies, but I do get a little irked at teh behavior."
    C "(I feel like I deserve an apology too, considering I was also interrupted!)"
    H "But there really is no stopping Izzie when she's set in her mind."
    T "She's almost as bad as both of you."
    H "Oh, {b}please{/b}. Get her to tell you some of the tales from her heyday."
    O "So basically what we are saying is that it's not {b}our{/b} fault at all."
    T "What do you think, Clover? Should we accept their apology?"
    "Tanya finally sees fit to drag me back into the conversation — both by her question toward me and literally by pulling my arm to shift my body closer to her side."
    C "Maybe... on one condition."
    "The gears start spinning delightfully in my head trying to come up with all the terribly satisfying things I could make the twins do, but rather than eventually grind to a halt they just keep spinning without ever finding an answer."
    C "(I need more time to think about this!)"
    H "Might I suggest \"sexual favors\"?"
    "Vittoria is clearly smiling directly at me when she offers her suggestion. Vincenza counters with another, directed at Tanya."
    O "How about... \"humiliating my bullies\"?"
    "The prospect of really sticking it to the girls who bullied Tanya does seem to interest her, but she instead chooses the higher road while I'm still stuck myself."

    C "(Don't get jealous. Don't get jealous. They do this every day. Don't get jealous.)"
    "Though the chants echo in my head, an unwanted flutter still tightens my chest as I stare down the oblivious Tanya."
    "Whipping the strawberry off the top of my own yogurt parfait, I cheerfully hold it out to Sibyl, who eagerly snaps it off my fingers just the same."
    S "Two strawberries in one day! Yum!"
    "To my deplorable delight, Tanya shoots a gaze full of complex emotions my way."

    S "Here ya go!"
    "For a group project, me, Tanya, and Sibyl are all cutting shapes out to semi-transparent tissue paper which we plan to layer on top of one another."

    "Tanya and I both share a very slightly contemptuous look for Miss Izzie's apology, but settle with telling her to not do it again, to which she exaggeratedly swears on the Virgin Mary herself."

    S "What was that all about?"
    T "Miss Izzie being Miss Izzie."

    "Sibyl glances between me and Tanya while waiting patiently for an explanation. Given all the random apologies she's borne witness to today, we both quietly fill her in on exactly what happened in the tree during our date."
    "Much to my surprise and betrayal, Sibyl ends up being on Miss Izzie's side of the argument."

    S "Were you able to smuggle your smartphone here without any issue?"
    C "It's just down the hall, Sibyl..."
    "Before we even decided to meet up today, Tanya and I both agreed that we wanted Sibyl to be a part of this phase of our date."

    T "Oh, stop— \"goth Clover\" is totally cute."

    T "I— I did."
    C "You did?"
    "Perhaps speaking too fast and suddenly regretting it, Tanya looks suddenly away, brushes a hand through her bangs, and leans back slightly away. Sibyl and I lean closer in response."
    T "I was a fat kid."
    C "What?"
    T "You heard me. I was {b}fat{/b} in middle school, so I know how it feels to want to forget big chunks of your past."
    S "I can hardly imagine it."
    T "Y-Yeah... but as painful as it is to remember how I was back then, I don't want to forget it because it makes me proud to see the results of all my hard work at the gym to get where I am now."

    S "That's {b}so{/b} sweet!"
    "I have to agree with Sibyl. Tanya's words easily sweep all the hard feelings out of my heart and leave it mushy with her saccharine feelings."
    C "O-Okay, but you're still going to show me your manhua, right?"
    "Tanya nods her assent, and glad to be off the topic of her traumatic middle school years, fiddles with her smartphone while Sibyl and I gather closely around either side so we can see her screen better."
    T "S-So... this is the last manhua I worked on. It's probably the best, or at least, it's the one which was made when my art skills were the best."
    C "(Tanya is so cute when she's so anxious and on edge!)"

    T "The title is {i}Heavy Love{/i}."
    T "The main character's name is Qiuyue. This is her—"
    "Past the title page, Tanya scrolls down to the first panel where we get a frame of the protagonist, who I presume to be a Chinese girl by her name and short, jet black hair."
    S "She's cute!"
    "I have to agree with Sibyl, and I do so aloud so that Tanya can hear it, as well as complement her artistic skills which are of course way above mine."
    C "So it's not a book? It's all this really long scrolly thing?"
    T "Yes. This is how most digital manhua is arranged."
    C "So I guess all the big white spaces between the frames is like a new page or something?"
    "Tanya continues scrolling through the first chapter, narrating text where necessary, though it is fairly easy to follow since it's just an introduction of the main character."
    "Qiuyue is a normal girl just starting out a new year at school. As she's getting dressed in the morning the day of the entrance ceremony, she pinches her chubby stomach with displeasure and swears to be skinny like a model."
    T "—And here's Clara. She's, umm, well, I did warn you that this was a baihe manhua, right?"
    "Clara is pretty foreign transfer student with wavy blonde hair and sapphire blue eyes. The frame when she first enters makes it quite clear that everyone, Qiuyue included, thinks she's just about the most beautiful person ever."
    C "(Maybe Sibyl can do {b}my{/b} hair that way too?)"
    S "Wow, she's all over her, huh?"
    T "Clara? Yeah, it's basically love at first sight for her. Qiuyue is {b}exactly{/b} her type."
    "The blonde foreign student shown immediate infatuation with the protagonist, to the point of getting way too close for strangers at her desk in front of the whole class."
    C "(Tanya really went all out with drawing those \"beauty sparkles\" around her!)"
    "As Tanya continues through the first chapter, it becomes clear why. Clara, a celebrity model from Norway is in China for a short term artistic residency, and is on a strict diet to kep her impossibly slim figure."
    "But, as Clara is quick to explain while following Qiuyue to where she intends to eat her lunch alone, she really loves soft chubby girls, and wants to feed Qiuyue all the foods she wishes she could eat."
    T "The main story of the work is how Qiuyue desperately wants to slim down while Clara conversely keeps pushing food on her."
    S "But, like, they're also lesbians?"
    "That much should be clear, I think, from the way Clara is shown squeezing Qiuyue's chubby thighs way too high up what is already a dizzyingly short skirt."
    T "Oh, yeah, they kiss and stuff later, but you probably don't want to see it."
    "Tanya quickly squeezes the side button of her smartphone to darken the screen as we finish the first chapter like she doesn't intend to go on to the second."
    S "I want to see it, Tanya! I've never seen you make any kind of artwork like this before."
    T "Even if there's a lot of kissing and other stuff?"
    S "I'm {b}fourteen years old{/b}, Tanya. I think I'll be fine seeing a drawing of cartoon characters kissing."
    T "R-Right..."

    S "{b}After{/b} a quick break! Wait for me, please!"
    "Sibyl dashes off to the adjoining bathroom, leaving Tanya alone with me in a way that suddenly feels kind of awkward. Wanting to ease the mood, I dredge up something to break the silence."
    C "So... is Sibyl going to be okay with the \"other stuff\" in the later chapters?"
    "For just a moment, Tanya stares blankly at me with her mouth half open, obviously unsure how to answer my question."
    T "She might not even realize what's happening...?"
    C "So they do {b}that kind of thing{/b} with each other!?"
    T "They do it {b}a lot{/b}, after a few chapters. We might not even get that far."
    C "They do it, {b}a lot{/b}!?"
    T "I needed an outlet for my own frustrations, okay?"
    "With some amusement do I realize exactly what Tanya means while she's so aggressively defending her artistic work."
    T "But because of the weird rules about publishing this kind of thing in China, it's no graphic at all and actually drawn very... {b}metaphorically{/b}."
    C "Metaphorically?"
    T "Can we just drop it for now? I want to hear more about what you were like as a goth."
    "Like she's desperate to drop the conversation, Tanya quickly reaches for my box and digs around to pull out something random from within it to ask me about."
    T "What's this?"
    "Luckily for her, I am willing to wait until it's my turn to get her to show me whatever smutty stuff she drew in middle school."
    C "That's my oujia board!"
    T "What do you... do with it?"
    C "It lets you communicate with spirits of the dead. Here, I'll show you!"
    T "Thanks, but no. I don't need to hear my ancestors asking me why I haven't been married yet."
    C "That's never happened to me before."
    T "{b}You're{/b} not Chinese."
    C "I thought you {b}wanted{/b} to know what I was like in middle school?"
    "Tanya's resistance falls away quickly after I hit her with that unfair one liner, and the two of us sit on either side of the board from one another."
    "With our hands together on either side  and our heads turned down with respect for the dead, I start us off."
    C "Spirits near and far: the most kind and gentle among ye, we humbly solicit to speak."
    "After raising our heads, we release each others' hands only to each place one upon the planchette atop the board."
    C "So all we have to do is ask questions and the spirits will answer!"
    T "With the board?"
    C "Yeah, the planchette will move letter by letter to reveal the spirit's answer."
    T "Uhh, okay... you start."
    "Putting on a bit of a theatrical voice, I ask of the first spirit to speak to us."

    "Even with my eyes fully adjusted to the darkness, I still struggle to find my way toward the lounge. As I turn the corner in the hallway, I accidentally smack my knee on the edge of the wall and exclaim just a little bit too loudly."
    T "Now's not the time to be a klutz."
    "The whispered sound of Tanya's voice floats out from the darkness just ahead, followed quickly by her figure appearing out of the darkness like a ghostly apparition."
    C "That {b}really{/b} hurt, you know!"
    T "What do you want me to do, kiss it?"
    C "Uhh, yeah, I do!"
    "There's a slight pause, then wordlessly the darkened silhouette of Tanya kneels down before me to pull my hand off my knee and touch her lips to the exact spot that I bumped it against the wall."
    T "Does that feel better?"
    "I confirm that Dr. Tanya's special treatment has worked as promised. When she rises, Tanya also leans in to press a peck against my lips too. It's a bit of a surprise, but not unwelcome."
    C "I didn't hurt myself there."
    "Hand in hand, we complete the short journey to the deserted midnight lounge. There we take places side-by-side on the big sofa while Tanya whips out her phone to start a movie at one click above muted volume."
    "The movie is just some rom-com that we both have seen before, but that doesn't matter to me in the slightest. All I want to do is get close to Tanya and do some \"girlfriend\" things."
    "After only five minutes of awkwardly sitting side-by-side, I raise my voice just barely above the sound of the movie in front of us."
    C "Hey, Tanya, do you want to...?"
    T "...Cuddle?"
    "It makes my heart leap to find that Tanya's thoughts are exactly in sync with mine on the matter, and that she wants to be close to me as much as I do her."
    "There's a good ten minutes where both of us shuffle this way and that atop the sofa. At first Tanya its up then I try to sit in front of her, but I just slide right off the front of the sofa."
    "Our second try involves me lying long ways and Tanya lying long ways beside me, but we both end up falling off. We swap spoon positions and body orientations again and again until we finally find a way to make it work satisfactorily."
    C "(Now {b}this{/b} is more like it! I'm so glad I was able to stay awake.)"
    "It's incredibly cozy lying the way I eventually find myself, with my back against Tanya's warm chest while she also lies long ways perpendicular to the arm rest."
    "Her arms wrap around my front naturally, enclosing around me above similarly to her legs below. I'd probably fall asleep instantly in such comfort if my heart weren't pounding so forcefully."
    C "(But I'm not the only one. I can hear Tanya's going crazy too!)"
    "I had originally wanted to position myself to be the big spoon rather than let Tanya gain the upper hand in something else, but now I am quite happy with this arrangement."
    "With Tanya's smartphone propped up on the top ledge of the sofa, we click play and resume the movie where we left off. As before, now again do I find myself focusing little on the movie and more on Tanya surrounding me."
    "I try my absolute hardest to not be a freak about it, but I just cannot resist touching Tanya's arms around me. It's just a little brush of my fingers against her forearm at first, but soon enough the allure of her biceps does me in."
    C "(How did she get so strong!?)"
    "Tanya doesn't say anything at all when I pinch the muscles in her arms up and down her biceps, nor when I switch to pinching the firm muscles in her thighs beside me."
    C "(It's probably because it feels good that she doesn't say anything. She wants me to touch her as much as I want her to touch me, after all.)"
    "I'm not alone in letting my hands roam. When I switch again to feeling the firm, smooth expanse of Tanya's strong legs, she moves her hands up to run her fingers through my flowing hair."
    C "That feels really nice."
    "Tanya doesn't reply to my soft, nearly inaudible whisper. She merely continues drawing my hair into groups of strands, loosely braiding them together, then releasing the braid only to start all over again."
    "I don't think either of us are actually watching the movie. I certainly am not."
    T "Are my arms and legs really that interesting?"
    "Tanya takes a turn to speak up at length, lightly questioning me on the way I touch her while not ceasing a microsecond in her treatment of my hair."
    "Several moments pass where the only sound is the quiet chatter of the movie playing nearby before I reply in my own soft whisper."
    C "I like touching you."
    "I can tell Tanya likes touching me too without her saying it. She shows no signs of ceasing the gentle tug of my hair while she braids it, and it feels so good that I don't want her stop either."
    C "...We're dating, right, Tanya?"
    T "Clover...?"
    C "Two people dating would mean they're girlfriends."
    T "Yeah."
    C "So you're my girlfriend."
    "Tanya's hands pause their activities for just a moment, raising a momentary concern in me, but Tanya follows me line of thought easily enough without having to explain."
    T "You're {b}my{/b} girlfriend, Clover."
    "A rush of warm fuzzies spread through my chest, and I turn aside slightly to rest my head against the shoulder of my {b}officially-a-girlfriend{/b}, facing away so she had easy access to all teh hair flowing down my back."
    "It's so warm and comfortable resting against her chest that I might fall asleep right away. A sudden flush of passion makes me reach out to clutch one of Tanya's arms to my chest, squeezing it tightly to my heart."
    "I'm not making it any easier for her to braid my hair, but she manages despite everything."
    C "Tanya?"
    T "Yes?"
    "Our voices drift lazily through the still air in the dead of night, like the spectral paths of the fireflies streaking warm greenish-yellow glows through the darkness just outside the window."
    C "Do you miss your family?"
    T "...Yeah, I do."
    C "Don't you want to go back to them?"
    T "...I do."
    C "Why don't you?"

    C "..."
    C "What if I {b}weren't{/b} here?"
    "The rhythmic brush of fingers through my hair steadies for a moment, resuming once Tanya presumably makes up her mind how to reply."
    T "Clover, what is with all the questions?"
    C "..."
    T "Clover?"
    C "My parents want me to return home after the school year is over."
    "Tanya's hand go still in my hair. They do not resume even after numerous long moments pass."
    T "For how long?"
    C "The summer..."
    "My voice trails off, clearly leaving more to say however little I want to say it. Tanya remains silent, waiting for me to say the painful words clearly for her."
    C "...maybe forever. Nothing has been decided."
    "I hate to ruin a moment as good as we had going, but Tanya and I don't always get to talk this honestly and sincerely with one another. It just felt like the right time to dredge up the things that I've been avoiding."
    C "What's going to become of... {b}us{/b}?"
    T "...Maybe it was all too good to be true."
    C "Huh? What do you mean?"
    T "Statistically, only two percent of high school romances survive."
    C "{b}Tanya!{/b}"
    "The name of what I {b}thought{/b} was my girlfriend rings out just a bit too loud for how quiet we're supposed to be, but my passions demand that they are heard."
    "My head shakes Tanya's fingers free of my fair blonde locks and I rise from her chest to flip around upon her, kneeling between her legs where I previously sat and looking down upon her surprised face with both hands by either side of her shoulders."
    T "C-Clover!?"
    C "Is {b}that{/b} what you think of {b}us{/b}!? Are my feelings— {b}our{/b} feelings, just a statistic!?"
    "My fingers grip into the upholstery of the sofa's armrest on either side of Tanya's head, my knuckles going white with my quiet fury. Tanya goes as pale as a ghost in the darkness and sinks deeper into the sofa than I thought possible."
    T "N-No, but...?"
    C "But {b}what{/b}!?"
    C "(Miss Woolsey is still with her high school girlfriend, isn't she? It's not fair to give up because of something so stupid!)"
    T "I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, Clover. It's all just my... insecurity getting the better of me."
    "My anger softens. There's no doubt in my mind that Tanya's backpedaling is not just for show. I've felt too much genuine passion and desire from her to believe she might never have really thought that much of me at all."
    T "I \"like\" you, a lot. Maybe {b}too{/b} much. That is how I feel about you, truthfully."
    "As much as I like the brash and confident Tanya, I like her just as much when she's being as vulnerable and cute as she is now."
    "My resistance to letting my arms go slack and kissing her right on the lips never materializes. I silence her lips with my own even though I'm nowhere near done interrogating her yet. I just need to kiss her right now before I go on."
    C "So... what are you so insecure about anyway? You know I \"like\" you. You know you \"like\" me. It's mutual."
    "Even in the darkness, I can see how sour my questioning is to her after coming off such a sweet shared kiss."
    T "You won't make fun of me if I tell you?"
    C "Not unless it's something really dumb, like that high school romance thing."
    "My first round of assurances are not enough for Tanya, who makes me promise unconditionally to hear her out. I know these are her most sincere feelings, and I want to hear them, so I give in without a fight."
    T "I'm concerned about how our relationship can last because I don't know what it's {b}built{/b} on. Like, what is the {b}foundation{/b} of our feelings keeping us together?"
    C "We're human beings, Tanya, not buildings."
    T "It's a metaphor, Clover."
    T "Remember the manhua I showed you before? I used to read a lot of that, and in every one the characters have these big, meaningful {b}reasons{/b} for harboring their feeling."
    T "There's always a shining moment where they just know they're meant to be together, like some big romantic gesture, or a dramatic confession, or like fate itself made them for each other."
    C "So what?"
    T "We don't {b}have{/b} anything like that, do we? We fight all the time, and... I'm afraid that I only like you because you're super hot and totally my type."
    C "For how often you call {b}me{/b} stupid, you should really take a good look in the mirror at the complete and utter {b}imbecile{/b} that you're making of yourself right now."
    "Tanya's face scrunches up all angry-like, no doubt because I'm insulting her for all of her insecurities that she so openly shared with me, but I don't stop there."
    C "We don't {b}need{/b} any \"shining moments\" or \"fated encounters\". So {b}what{/b} if you think I'm hot? I think {b}you're{/b} hot!"
    C "There doesn't have to be a {b}reason{/b} for us to be together. All that matters is that you want to be here by my side, and that I want you to be here with me too."
    T "That's probably the smartest thing you've ever said, Clover."
    C "Try to remember it next time I say something really dumb, okay?"
    T "I'll keep it fresh in my mind for tomorrow."
    "All anger fades from Tanya's face as she listens to me, and in return for my surprise kiss earlier, she cranes her neck up to give me the same affection I showed to her earlier."
    T "You know that you're crazy sexy, right, Clover?"
    C "That's what you and Vittoria keep saying, but I don't know if I really believe it."
    T "{b}Believe it.{/b}"
    "The deep brown of Tanya's eyes {b}burn{/b} into my face half-lidded, while her hands roam from my shoulders, across my chest, past my waist, and finally hook behind me high up my thighs to pull me further atop her."
    "My suddenly very amorous girlfriend's strong lacrosse arms reach around my back and pulls me down tightly into a kiss like no other that has probably ever been seen at such a dignified academy."
    "Jitters stronger than any sugar rush I've ever had before flood through my body. The feeling of her fingers gripping into the uniform around my back alone makes me quiver in my necktie; such in the strength of the desire I feel from Tanya."
    "Being on top feels amazing, even if it's Tanya's keeping me held close and not me pushing her down. Her hold is so firm that I have to squeeze my hands up between the tangled mess of our hair to separate us ever so slightly, just so I don't suffocate."
    C "Nng!"
    "A heavenly sound vibrates from Tanya's throat and through my ears to echo in my brain, louder than even the sounds of our sloppy kissing reverberating in my skull. I brain quickly connects the sound to the motion of my hand accidentally brushing over her chest."
    C "What the {b}heck{/b} was that!? That was so {b}sexy{/b}!"
    "A powerful desire to hear more of those cute sounds pour out of Tanya suddenly washes over me, like the hot sun over the desert. Tanya's firm, athletic body are the sands, and I the sun."
    "Again do I pass my palm over her chest, intentionally, and find her flesh respond immediately, as does her throat. Her small moans and pleasured exhales spur me only further, wanting to pass her chest and spread my warms even lower."
    T "Mnn! Clover, wait, Clover!"
    "Tanya removes her arms from around my back and snatches at my hand just as it washes over Tanya's quivering stomach."
    C "W-What!?"
    "I blink down at Tanya who pushes me up and away by my shoulder with one arm like it's entirely effortless, but I'm too focused on the rosiness of her heated cheeks to think too much of her strength."
    T "Today... isn't good for me."
    C "You mean...?"
    T "Yeah. So I don't want to have sex. Is that alright...?"
    "I hadn't even intentioned to be reaching {b}that{/b} low just yet, but clearly Tanya was concerned that I might enough to stop what we were doing {b}cold{/b}."
    C "Y-Yeah..."
    C "(I think I've heard that you have to wait for the third date to have sex anyway....? This is the second, or, like, two and a half-th?)"
    T "Are you disappointed?"
    C "No, I can wait."
    "My answer maybe doesn't sound so sincere, because Tanya glances silently up at me in the darkness for several moments."
    "I honestly mean what I say when I tell her that I don't need to be that physical with her right now. The uncertainty that tinges my reply comes from the knowledge that our time remaining at the academy is limited."
    C "(And there might not ever {b}be{/b} another moment like this...)"
    T "Come here..."
    "Tanya's arms once again pull me into a great big embrace, but this time she pulls my head across her shoulder to tenderly enclose my body against her own."
    "Her hand brushes through my hair down my back in long, slow motions, while the sound of her now calmed breathing rises and falls against my side where we lay together."

    C "(I never knew that hugs could feel so good.)"

    mw "This my be our second to last game of the season, but we've got a strong crowd tonight. I want you all to get out there and give all of your friends in the bleachers something to cheer about! Who's with me?"

    "Their team is big, and strong. Tanya is big and strong too, but then these girls are {b}big{/b} and move way faster than I feel they should for their size."
    "One of their defenders in particular is a mountain — tall, bulky, and mean. She might not be able to move as quickly as the others, but from her position on defense she tears up our attacking team with her size, reach, and force."
    C "(She may be an un-moveable mountain by the goal, but me and Tanya are so in sync with each other that we can definitely find a way around her!)"
    "As if she hears my thoughts, Miss Woolsey swaps me in as her first choice substitution."
    C "That defender is really something."
    T "Yeah..."
    "I catch up to Tanya out on the field as the rest of the changes happen. She exchanges a quick conversation with me despite how hard she's breathing after running her butt off even more than most games."

    C "(She's got it!)"
    "I pump my first as I watch Tanya pivot to find her next pass to our offensive team, but the big, large Quabbin girl is on her quickly, blocking her passing lanes and getting up in her face."
    "My frustrations to see our plan falter at her stubborn defense release as a growl as I trot up the field to support. It's not just me frustrated, clearly, as the defender keeps Tanya from passing but can't dispossess her."
    C "C'mon, Tanya, she doesn't have half the skills you have!"
    "My encouragement seems to work on Tanya, but only makes the Quabbin girl more ferocious as well."
    "Ultimately, she puts her size to use, sneaking in a slash of the stick that hits against Tanya's arm, and which the official doesn't catch."
    "I yell it out loud and point toward the offender, and so do many of my teammates, but the official does nothing. What should have ended there only continues, with the defender not giving up."
    "Perhaps emboldened by getting away with a penalty already, the defender attempts another risky poke check to try to knock the ball free."
    "She only succeeds in whacking her crosse against Tanya's face, stunning her briefly, but with enough time that she has no hope of trying to block a nasty follow-up cross check that sends her tumbling hard face-first into the grass below."
    C "Tanya...!"
    "She lies still in the dirt for too long. My heart thumps so heavily in my chest that it feels like it'll explode out, and I take off running toward my girlfriend crumpled on ground atop the torn up grass and dirt."

    mi "And you don't have to do it alone either! Your friends will always be there to help scoop your big pile of shit."
    C "{b}What{/b} are you saying!?"
    "It's clear enough that Miss Izzie is no therapist, nor a guidance councilor, nor anyone at all that has any qualification to give advice, but she's trying her best and actually getting through somewhat."
    "Letting me go, I stare dumbstruck at Miss Izzie, who herself seems pleased at my turnaround from morose to flabbergasted. She withdraws her hands from either side to strike a pose and confidently raise my spirits."
    mi "So don't you start moping, Clover. Everyone makes mistakes, and as far as your mistake goes, it's barely even a rounding error. It's like the \"minus one point for spelling error in an essay\" type of error: totally inconsequential."
    mi "Your teammates will understand why you confronted that girl; Miss Woolsey will forgive you for it, that I can {b}promise{/b} you; and Tanya's probably ready to slobber all over your clit for standing up for her like that."
    "Despite the weird phrasing, I do start to feel some of the creeping dread melt away from me as Miss Izzie rambles on at me. Lightness returns to my limbs of the sort I had only hours before while waiting for the game to start."
    S "What did I just walk into?"
    "Out of stage left appears Sibyl suddenly, cheeks tinted pink with a sot flush of exertion I've seen on her face after running too hard in gym class."
    C "Sibyl!"
    mi "A pep talk, that's what! Take it from here, Sibyl! My job is done!"
    "Miss Izzie disappears just as quickly as she does in art class, her short legs carrying her away now that my emotional self has been somehow stabilized and transferred into the care of my Vertu partner."
    S "How is she?"
    "Sibyl breaks the ice quietly, turning to look at the doorway behind which lies Tanya and the nurse, then back to me expectantly."
    C "The nurse says it's a mild concussion and the best thing we can do for her is let her get some rest."
    "Taking a step forward, Sibyl takes one of my hands into her own probably so that I can't escape her as I'd done so many times before when I first started at the academy."
    S "How are {b}you{/b}?"
    "The question brings me to pause for a moment. It shouldn't be a surprise that Sibyl, who has long ago already shown a supernatural understanding of my emotions better than I have, should know exactly what's causing me trouble now."
    "She doesn't know any of the particulars of course, so I fill her in on what red cards mean in lacrosse, and how in addition to being thrown out of the game today, that I won't be able to participate in the next and final game either."
    "Much of the same points which Miss Izzie brought up are once again reiterated by Sibyl, though in a much more gentle manner."
    S "That Quabbin player was in the wrong, Clover. I was angry too. She hurt Tanya, my friend, and your—"
    "Sibyl pauses, probably not quite sure exactly how things stand between me and Tanya at the moment, and not wanting to make a mistake in such a sensitive moment. I helpfully finish for her."
    C "Girlfriend."
    S "Your {b}girlfriend{/b}, Clover. Even if what you did wasn't \"right\", it's only natural for you to want to come to her aid. No one blames you for that."
    "I'm not about to fall apart. No tears wet my eyes. I've been through so much already that it feels more like the metaphorical pile of crap that Miss Izzie mentioned is around my ankles."

    C "Oh, you're awake. You didn't answer when I knocked at the door. How are you feeling?"

    "The terrifying reality of the moment leaves me paralyzed and stuck unable to decide what I should do."
    "I could wait for the nurse to arrive and probably tell me that this is a symptom of her concussion which will hopefully pass, but I could run back to my room, dive back into my bed, and try waking up for real this time."
    "The latter option increasingly feels like my best hope, but just as my muscles are warming up to sprint all the way back to the dorms, the vacuous expression on Tanya's face turns slowly fills in once again."

    "The color which had quickly drained out of my face returns just as swiftly, but goes even further as I turn red with anger."
    "Without a single word, I jump atop the nurse's bed to straddle my knees on either side of Tanya and reach out to grab at Tanya's uniform by the collar."
    C "When I'm through with you, you're going to wish that girl had sent you to the hospital out of my reach..."
    "The fury in my voice is no doubt as evident as the darkness of the expression plainly visible across my face."
    T "W-Wait, Clover, I'm sorry, I—"
    "Tanya pleads forgiveness for her callous little trick, but that doesn't stop me from yanking her upper body toward me by her collar and pressing the hardest, most angry kiss against her lips, then dropping her back against the pillow."
    "With a huff, I sit back on the bed and try to let me relief that Tanya recognizes me and seems to be perfectly normal outweigh my anger from the little stunt she pulled."
    "Tanya remains stunned by my vengeance for a few moments longer before apologizing once again."
    T "Sorry, really Clover, I'm so sorry. I woke up when you knocked and didn't wasn't really all the way there yet when you walked in, and groggy me though it would be a funny prank."
    "I glare at Tanya silently from across the bed, but the relief at hearing Tanya's voice form words I can actually understand once again evaporates most of the anger in short order."
    C "You really scared me, Tanya. You went all crazy yesterday after you got bowled over on the field and I was {b}really{/b} worried about you."
    T "I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
    C "You deserve a {b}way{/b} worse punishment than the one you just got."
    T "If that was my punishment, then I will accept more... after I'm fully cleared for rough play."
    "Climbing off the bed, I pull up a chair to sit next to Tanya where it will be comfortable for both of us."
    C "What do you mean?"
    C "(With Tanya speaking English and being a total meanie, she seems all but back to normal already.)"
    T "I still have a little brain fog but that should clear up with a lot of rest to let my brain heal. The nurse said that I should not do anything stressful in mind or body for a few days."
    C "So... no lacrosse."
    T "No lacrosse. No classes. Just sleeping in my bed."
    C "That sounds {b}amazing{/b}."
    T "It sounds like I'm going to be bored out of my mind at best."

    T "At worst, I'll be bored out of my mind while also stuck with Sierra {b}all day{/b}."
    C "I'll visit you whenever I can, I promise!"
    "Rather than reply right away, Tanya cants her head slightly to smile my direction, then slips a hand free from under the bed sheets to find my own."
    T "I'd {b}love{/b} that, Clover."
    "Tanya may have only been expressing how much she appreciates me visiting her while she's unwell, but the way she looks into my eyes while tenderly holding my hand makes me feel that \"L\" word might have just as well been used more directly."
    C "(Maybe Tanya isn't actually completely back to normal after all...?)"
    "It could just be the concussion making her more amorous than normal, I think, but the warm jitters raising the hair all the way from where her hand touches mine to the back of my neck is not at all unwelcome."
    C "(Maybe Miss Izzie wasn't so wrong about Tanya...)"
    T "I must have been out of it mentally at the time because I don't remember anything much at all, but Na— Miss Woolsey told me all about what you did in that game."
    C "She told you about my red card?"
    "My expression droops so quickly I feel like my face might just drip off my skull, but Tanya's warm smile cheers me right back up."
    T "Yes, but also what you did to earn it. Thank you, Clover."
    C "But now I won't be able to play in the final game. I let my emotions get the best of me and the whole team suffers for it. Isn't that what you always tell me off about?"
    T "Maybe you were way too selfish in the past, but now your first thought is how you've let down the team, and not how you personally won't be able to win glory by playing in the final game."
    T "You've changed so much, Clover. To think I used to hate you so much, and now..."
    "Tanya's gaze lowers to a simmer yet again, and her hand tugs gently at mine, leading me toward her. Butterflies emerge from their cocoons and go mad trying to escape my stomach."
    C "W-Wait, is this okay? Don't you still need to rest?"
    "A soft pout crosses Tanya's lips, now so very close to mine, but it clears immediately."
    T "The nurse doesn't have to know."
    "Never ever in my life so far as anything been quite so sensual as that moment, half leaning over the infirmary bed, staring into Tanya's impassioned face."

    nurse "Ahem— you have some... {b}other{/b} visitors, Tanya."
    "A whole gaggle of girls push through the doorway after the nurse. Each and every one of them are fellow Wild Roses coming to shower their best wishes on Tanya, and even tell me how cool I was too."
    C "(So they're not mad at me for that whole incident?)"
    "Rather than be angry at me for getting thrown out of the game, it is to my surprise and great pleasure that they actually are happy that I stood up for Tanya and hte rest of the team against the charter school bullies."

    "The question asked way out of the blue stuns me at the moment it was asked, but Tanya answers without any such delay — and with a soft squeeze to the hand we've not released the whole time since."

    C "(Breakfast?)"
    "My stomach rumbles just at the word. Thankfully, as the nurse shuffles the well-wishers out, Sibyl and Sierra follow in with trays stuffed with breakfast food for all of us."
    C "Sibyl, thank you...!"
    "Small tears well up in my eyes, and though Tanya jokes that I'm more happy to see breakfast arrive than to find her recovering well, I think we both know Im just so touched to have my life going so well despite everything."
