    "The deep brown of Tanya's eyes smolder into my face half-lidded, while her hands roam from my shoulders, across my chest, past my waist, and finally hook behind my body low upon my back to pull me further atop her."
    "My suddenly very amorous girlfriend's strong lacrosse arms pull me down tightly into a kiss like no other that has probably ever been seen at such a dignified academy. She might be crushing me if I weren't giving in so easily."
    "Jitters stronger than any sugar rush I've ever had before flood through my body. The feeling of her fingers gripping into the uniform around my back alone makes me quiver in my necktie; such in the strength of the desire I feel from Tanya."
    "Being on top feels amazing, even if it is Tanya keeping me held close and not me pushing her down. Her hold is so firm that I have to squeeze my hands up between the tangled mess of our hair to separate us ever so slightly, just so I don't suffocate."
    C "Nng!"
    "A heavenly sound vibrates from Tanya's throat and through my ears to echo in my brain, louder than even the sounds of our sloppy kissing reverberating in my skull."
    "My brain quickly connects the sound to the motion of my hand accidentally brushing over her chest."

    "Again do I pass my palm over her chest, intentionally, and find her flesh respond immediately, as does her throat. Her small moans and pleasured exhales spur me only further, wanting to pass her chest and spread my warmth even lower."

    "Tanya frantically removes her arms from around my back and snatches at my hand just as it washes over Tanya's quivering stomach."

    "For the longest time, we both lie upon on another, our bodies pressed closely such that I can feel Tanya's heart pounding even through our uniforms."
