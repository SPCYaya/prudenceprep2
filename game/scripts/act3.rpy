    "The twins don't chase me as I stomp down the hallway back the way I came, burning with passion the whole way."
    "In typical fashion for me, being challenged only strengthens my resolve to subsequently prove the twins wrong."
    "With my mind whirling and nowhere in particular to go I end up returning back to my dorm room where I come suddenly face to face with Sibyl."
    C "Eyeep!"
    "A little squeal of surprise leaks from my lips from having to directly confront the girl who has my brain all mixed up so badly."
    "After fending off her concerns for my supposed illness, I sit down at my desk to try to actually do some of that homework that I meant to do yesterday."
    C "(The sine is... the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.)"
    C "(...Hippopotenuse. Sibyl would think that's funny.)"
    "My fingers flick my mechanical pencil against a printed diagram of a right triangle while my gaze flicks aside to where Sibyl reclines on her bed."
    "Sibyl finished her homework last night while I was in bed pretending to be sick. Her beautiful blue eyes now sweep from side to side as she reads through the lines of her latest novel."
    "Turning back to my homework, I try to wrap my head around trigonometry once again but just as quickly have my mind pulled away to matters more important to my well-being."
    "Idly, I pencil in a \"C\" at one end of a hypotenuse, and \"S\" at the other. On the right angle, I draw in a small \"T\" as an aside."
    C "(Hmm...)"
    "I stare at the labelled right triangle so long that the image gets burned into my brain but nothing comes to mind that will make the hypotenuse shorter and brings those two letters together."
    "Taking a different approach, I pick up my smartphone and flip to a fresh page of my notebook."
    "The keyboard on my screen flickers to life as I type my question into the search bar: \"how to make a girl fall in love with you\"."
    C "(\"Six Simple Steps\"? Is that all it takes?)"
    "I jot down the highlights into a series of bullet points and leave plenty of space in between to fill in my notes."
    C "(Step One: Be yourself!)"
    "There's a whole paragraph that follows it but I skip reading all that in its entirety because I've always been myself my whole life of course."
    "In the empty lines I left to take notes of what I should do to fulfill the first step I draw a giant check mark to take up the space."
    C "(Step Two: Look good and feel good!)"
    "Sibyl might be far and away more beautiful with her soft, fluffy hair and eyes that anyone would get lost in, but I think I'm decently pretty the way I am after ditching the goth gear."
    C "(Blondes are pretty popular, right? So I've got that going for me too.)"
    "As far as \"feeling\" good, that's easy. I haven't felt as good than I do now since before all the nastiness of the fallout with my middle school friends and my parents' divorce."
    C "(Ugh...)"
    "What is supposed to be an optimistic thought I unexpectedly find still strike at surprisingly deep wounds even after having thought I'd made peace with them."
    C "(Sibyl has it worse than me. She never even knew her parents.)"
    "My pen scrawls out a slightly more modest check mark for the second step of the list. My wounds have not fully healed but if I can win over Sibyl they won't hurt anywhere near as bad."
    C "(Step Three: Take an interest in her!)"
    "I have to read further on with this one because obviously I'm interested in her or I wouldn't be here searching on the web for how to win her over like this."
    "What the step wants me to do is be open and communicative, and also take an interest in her life and hobbies."
    C "(I've already been doing that, but I can do more too!)"
    "With a broad smile, I give step three another big check mark. Proud of myself, I snatch another gaze aside at the girl I'm going to win over to reward myself for being so well ahead of all the steps."
    C "(Step Four: Befriend her friends!)"
    "I have to re-read step four more times to be sure that I read it correctly. The words don't change no matter how many times I read them."
    "The nervous habit of tapping my pencil against the paper emerges once again as I stare into the blank lines I left under the step. I know what I need to write in there but lack the courage to do so."
    C "(If it means making Sibyl mine... I will do it.)"
    "In small print I write simply, \"befriend Tanya\"."
    C "(Enough of that. Step Five: Be flirtatious!)"
    "Once again, I physically blink at the outrageously simple heading for something so difficult."
    C "(Why does it just {b}assume{/b} I know how to flirt?)"
    "I read through the paragraph below the step header for more details. It's clearly written with a guy in mind but it's not entirely unhelpful for me either."
    C "(\"Make her known you're interested in more than friendship.\" Smiling, frequent eye contact, playful comments...)"
    "I read on further to try to find out how this is any different from normal friendship, but entirely fail to understand what makes flirting \"flirting\"."
    C "(And the first three steps were going to smoothly too...)"
    "Ultimately, I just note it down as something to do more research on later and work on further."
    C "(Step Six: Get physical!)"
    "At first I think this step is something salacious but it turns out to mean using small touches to increase our physical bond."
    "I don't immediately see how this is possible to be done smoothly but feel confident enough that I can work simple touches into our everyday routines."
    C "Okay, done! Now I just need to work on those few tricky parts."
    "Skipping quickly over step four, I review the other steps to my master seduction plan and decide to put it into practice right away."
    C "Sibyl!"
    "My crush's name slips smooth as silk from my lips as I walk over to her bed. Her attention draws away from her novel and onto me, just as planned."
    C "What's up, Clover? Need some help with the homework?"
    "My feet pause when I reach her bed. Thinking quickly, I sit right on the edge and place my hand casually on her shoulder."
    C "Your eyes are so pretty. What's your favorite color?"
    "It's a sure win, or so I think initially, but every passing microsecond that Sibyl gives me a strange look like I'm not even speaking English lessens my confidence."
    S "...Yellow."
    S "Are you sure you're feeling all right, Clover?"
    "Sibyl turns quickly to face me, far too close for comfort given the emotional state I'm in right now, and lays her palm against my forehead."
    S "You feel warm..."
    C "(That's because you're so close!)"
    C "Yup, so good, never better!"
    "Sibyl doesn't seem to think me any more sane than before so I just take the little victories I've earned and play off the rest as an awkward way of asking for help with homework."
    "As it turns out, homework is {b}so{/b} much more enjoyable when Sibyl is sitting close beside me and explaining everything right into my ear. I almost don't want to it be over so quickly."

    "At lunch on Monday I take the seat at Sibyl's other side completely opposite of Tanya rather than sit across from her as usual."
    "I intentionally sit close enough that I'm sure to brush my shoulders against her plenty. When Sibyl slides down the bench slightly, I subtly do the same until we're rubbing shoulders once again."
    S "Is there something wrong with the other side of the table, Clover?"
    C "No. I just felt like sitting next to you today."
    "In truth, I prefer to be opposite of Sibyl where I can enjoy each expression on her face as she converses with Tanya, from the way her cheeks puff up wth laughter to how high her eyebrows raise with surprise."
    S "That's all well and good, but I feel like a sardine."
    C "No way! You're not extremely salty and disgusting!"
    S "I mean how they're always tightly packed together into cans."
    T "Just move to the other side of the table, Clover."
    "Tanya only now breaks from her back and forth conversation with Sibyl, though I have caught some glowering glances my direction thus far into our mealtime."

    C "But I want to sit beside Sibyl too!"

    C "So what are all these vials for?"
    "I feel like an idiot asking but the tray full of small vials of differently colored mystery liquids Sibyl sets at our lab station are unlabelled."
    S "Were you even listening during the lecture?"
    "I honestly was not. It's so hard to concentrate when our science teacher starts droning on, and now that I understand how I feel about Sibyl it's so much easier to get lost in her auburn curls."
    C "Sorry. I kinda zoned out."
    S "You've been kinda spacey lately, Clover. Are you sure you're alright?"
    C "Never better!"
    "I try to reassure her that I'm just fine without giving away my strong new feelings for her before she's ready to accept them. Sibyl gives me a suspicious glance but turns back to her work."
    S "The abstract for the experiment should go over the basics. Please read through it while I sort these out."
    "Lifting up the page, I read the title of the experiment we are doing today."
    "\"Determining Acidity by Titration with an Indicator Solution\""
    C "What's a \"tit-ration\"."
    S "{b}Titration{/b}."
    "Sibyl corrects me quickly, probably embarrassed at my phrasing given how she glances around to see if anyone heard me say that aloud."
    C "(I want some of Sibyl's tit-rations.)"
    S "Titration is adding a solution with a known concentration into a a solution with an unknown solution to determine concentration."
    S "For the purposes of our lab, we are going to first note the color change as we add the {i}titrant{/i}."
    C "(Tit-rant.)"
    "I must be feeling extras stupid today. Every since discovering how I feel about Sibyl it's just about all I can think about."
    "Sibyl goes on to explain even more about the experiment but it only half gets through my head as I zone out once more to focus on how pretty she looks while concentrating."
    C "(She's doing it again!)"
    "Sibyl has this funny mannerism where her tongue just barely sticks out from between her lips to be held lightly with her teeth."
    "Usually this comes out when she's focused on something intricate with her artwork, but now it's because she's trying hard to slowly count out drops from a pipette."
    S "There we go! Would you like to do the honors, Clover?"
    C "Huh? Oh, sure..."
    "Sibyl finishes up whatever she's doing while I'm still gawking and I try to cover up my absentmindedness by pretending I know what I'm doing by volunteering for the next task."
    C "Remind me again how I should do this part?"
    S "Just one drop at time from the pipette. I'll tell you when to stop."
    "The click of a pen tells me it's time to go. I squeeze the dropper ever so slightly and let one drop loose, then turn back expectantly toward Sibyl."
    S "Keep going."
    "We do this a few more times until Sibyl suddenly tells me to hold off. Showing me her notes, she points out the difference in color between the new vial and our control vial."
    S "With this, we can do a small calculation to estimate the concentration difference and plot a titration curve!"
    C "Sibyl, you're a genius!"
    "Sibyl beams at the compliment. What I tell her is no mere flattery; things that make no sense to me suddenly aren't so scary once Sibyl explains them."
    C "Can you just marry me so I don't have to think so hard ever again."
    "With her genial mood as it is I try to squeeze in a little flirting, like planting the idea of marriage in her mind while playing it off as a joke."
    "I even try to reduce the physical distance between us by taking her free hand while she's writing so that I can examine her ring finger."
    "It's all in good fun, I believe, but the falter in a newly cautious smile upon Sibyl's face tells a very different story than what I'd hoped would play out."
    S "Come now, Clover. You have to learn all this for yourself. I will not always be around."
    C "(Why {b}can't{/b} you be?)"
    "Sibyl withdraws the hand I took of hers to bring back close to her chest, then turn away from me to finish writing down the details of our experimental results."
    C "(She's just worried about my performance on our exams, right?)"
    "While I am left wondering about the shift in mood behind Sibyl's back, I spot Tanya and Sierra at the far end of the room."
    "Something clearly has gone wrong because Tanya's face is dripping with {b}something{/b} wet and she's angrily brandishing one of those tubes Sibyl calls a {i}burette{/i} at Sierra."
    S "Would you like to review my work, Clover?"
    "Sibyl turns to offer the worksheet out to me to verify our lab findings. It doesn't make any real sense to me but it's good to see Sibyl return to her usual self once again."

    "I keep trying my hardest to break through to Sibyl, but my efforts seem only to be doing the opposite."
    "Rather than make her fall in love wih me, I feel like she is only getting pushed further away."
    "I know I'm not exactly an expert at seduction but Sibyl really is a total brick wall. She's not picking up on a single thing I say or do."
    C "(There's not a {b}single{/b} article about same-sex relationships in any of these {i}Girls' Mix{/i} issues!)"
    "While picking through a stack of magazines in the library one evening, I come across a book title which I think I can use to flirt with Sibyl."
    C "Hey, Sibyl check it out! I didn't know they wrote a book about you?"
    "I hold back the book for just long enough to pique her interest and draw her attention away from the new novel she picked up just a few minutes ago."
    C "It's {i}A Little Princess{/i}. Because you're so cute and good at etiquette class. ...Get it?"
    "I wave the book I found in front of Sibyl, but her expression remains particularly stony."
    S "You don't know anything about that book, do you?"
    C "Well the... girl on the cover kind of looks like you, doesn't she?"
    S "It's about a girl who becomes an orphan and all the terrible things that surround that."
    C "O-Oh sorry, I didn't realize..."
    "I quickly stuff the book behind my back and offer Sibyl the most sheepish apology ever granted in all of history."
    C "(Way to go, Clover! You picked the worst book possible.)"
    "I try to leave Sibyl out of my family life for now after having made such a big fuss about my parents' divorce and then showing her all the things they sent me to show they love me."
    S "It's okay, Clover. I know you didn't mean anything by it. And the story ends well enough I suppose."
    "Somehow I am not surprised at all that Sibyl has read this random book I pulled off the shelves. Knowing now that it is about an orphan girl, perhaps it is not mere coincidence."
    S "I'm fine with it, you know? Being an orphan, I mean. My foster families have always been kind and welcoming."
    "This topic is something I've rarely heard Sibyl bring up since she first told me. She always seems rather positive about it, but somehow I feel like there's a distinct lack of depth behind the smile."
    C "(Maybe it's the way that she always seems to be looking down when she speaks about it. I'd rather see her looking up!)"
    "When I sit down across the table from Sibyl she looks back up again, right at me."
    S "Sorry, I'm spoiling the mood, aren't I? I can read it on your face, you know."
    S "Take comfort in the knowledge that I am doing well just the way I am. I have a big future ahead of me and lots of plans, so don't you worry."
    "Seeing Sibyl cheer up goes a long way to helping me shake off the awkwardness of my blunder just moments before."
    C "What sort of plans do you have, Sibyl? Are you going to be an author... or some kind of fancy artists?"
    "I've never heard any of these grand plans Sibyl has, so naturally it's all I really want to hear about when she brings it up suddenly."
    S "Maybe, I would probably have to attend an art school for that, though, and I don't know if I'm good enough."
    C "You're good enough! You're {b}way{/b} good enough!"
    "Sibyl laughs softly and tells me to calm down, then reiterates that her art is't anything special despite my renewed protests."
    S "What I mean is that I want to be a mother. Some day I am going to have a big, happy family and I'll be the best mother in the world."
    "Unlike before, I can now see the warmth return to pool behind SIbyl's cool blue eyes."
    C "You'll be the best foster mother ever, I'm sure of it."
    S "I may foster some children, but I want my own children to love too. I want them more than anything."
    C "Y-Yeah, science is getting pretty good these days."
    "My reply comes out loose and mumbling. I can feel my body go stiff and hands clam up as I sit at the table across from Sibyl."
    "Perhaps Sibyl notices me going rigor mortis because she reaches across to take my hand, an action which instantly revives me with her warmth."
    S "Clover, you will always be my friend. No matter what happens, know that I will {b}always{/b} be here for you. I hope I can count on the same from you."
    "I only pray she doesn't feel my hand tremble when she says the word \"friend\"."
    C "(Yeah, I want to be her friend. I want to be her {b}girl{/b}friend!)"
    "I try to play it cool but my brain is screaming out to tell her I need to be more than \"friends\" with her."
    "At the same time, some small part of me is telling my brain that maybe it should stay silent."
    C "O-Of course, Sibyl. You're my best friend in the world."
    "Sibyl smiles so brightly when I reply to her that al other thoughts completely leave my mind. She releases my hand herself after I fail to do it on my own."
    "I sit there for what must be a few minutes but feels like hours, just contemplating the short exchange we shared while Sibyl silently returns to her novel across from me."
    "The only conclusion that I arrive at is that I will have to do the one thing I most wish I would not have to."

    H "Sibyl does not seem the type to respond well to pick up lines."
    "I'm a little surprised at how rationally Vittoria is listening to me. It's quite possible that how I have acted in the past only encourages she and her sister to act out further."

    mi "Your little doggie. The layers are all off after the table was bumped, see?"

    mi "Oh, Clover, right on time! I have other students to check on, but maybe you could fill her in on the idea, Sibyl?"
    S "I can take it from here, Miss Izzie."
    "My mischievous art teacher again sends me a thumbs up as she departs but I am much more interested in what Sibyl is talking about now."
    S "Miss Izzie has a wonderful idea. So remember how I did that portrait of you a few weeks back?"
    "There's no way I would have forgotten the nude drawing she made of me so soon after meeting her. It was strange at the time, but now I'd gladly strip everything right off to model for her, if she'd do the same."
    "My reply comes out with a modest \"yes\" without needing to tell her about all the rest."
    S "Miss Izzie thinks it's a good opportunity to translate the same subject into a tactile medium."
    C "Tactile...?"
    S "Like a sculpture! Rather than look at you and translate that into a two dimensional drawing, Miss Izzie thinks it would be beneficial for me to {b}feel{/b} you with my hands to mold clay."
    "When Sibyl says what she does, I can barely believe it."
    C "(She wants to... {b}feel{/b} me. My naked body. {b}Over and over again{/b}, diligently enough to perfectly sculpt me by touch alone.)"
    "My brain kind of freezes for a moment. I don't know what expression could possibly be on my face but Tanya sure isn't about to let this incredible development proceed without a fight."
    T "Look at her! I knew this was a bad idea."
    "Tanya quickly turns to Sibyl, wasting no time in grabbing her hand and drawing her attention away from me."
    T "I'm totally fine with it though! We've already both painted nude studies before, remember? So I know how to model properly. The {b}natural{/b} choice is obviously to choose me, and I want to do it!"
    "I've never seen Tanya speak as quickly as she does now, half vomiting words and half pleading with Sibyl to sculpt her over me."
    C "{b}No!{/b}"
    "I shout out into the space between Sibyl and Tanya, drawing the attention of everyone immediately surrounding us. The eyes suddenly on me freeze me to my core but thankfully fade away just as quickly."
    C "I mean, Miss Izzie was right. I'm her Vertu partner, and she already drew me, so it's got to be me, right? I'll do it."
    S "Are you sure? if you really don't want to I'll just have Tanya—"
    C "{b}I want to do it!{/b}"
    "I cannot begin to comprehend what Sibyl must be thinking, but in the end she agrees to model me and wanders off to the storeroom to fetch clay for the project."
    T "I'm seriously going to murder you."
    "Tanya makes her feelings about the situation clear the moment Sibyl leaves the two of us alone."
    C "Not before I get felt up all over by Sibyl, you're not."
    "It is expressly clear that Tanya has yet more to say, but Sibyl returns quickly enough that she just goes back to her painting while also keeping a sharp eye on the two of us."
    C "S-So do you want me to... s-strip here, or...?"
    "Now that it's come down to it, I'm starting to feel self-conscious about the prospect of stripping down right in the middle of art class, even if it means Sibyl touching my naked body."
    "The combination of lacrosse exercise and fewer French toast breakfasts has been working like a charm but I'm still not {b}that{/b} confident in my body."
    S "Strip? I'm just doing a bust, Clover."
    C "B-Bust...?"
    "My hands raise up to my chest without thinking. My chest isn't anything particularly special but it would still be awkward to take my top off here."
    "The first sign that I have a terrible misconception of what Sibyl wants to do is when I hear Tanya's viciously mirthful snickering from nearby."
    S "No, I mean a sculpture bust. That's just your shoulder on up. You won't need to take anything off at all."
    C "O-Oh...."
    "I {b}know{/b} my face must be burning crimson but Sibyl doesn't call me on it, instead just getting her workspace set up while I sit patiently trying not to squirm in my chair."
    "When the time finally comes to begin, Sibyl merely stands before me visually inspecting me all over but not touching one bit."
    C "I-I thought you were supposed to, umm.. {b}touch{/b} me."
    S "Yes, you're right, but... hmm, I just don't know where to start."
    "I suddenly realize that it's not just me who is anxious about this whole thing and that maybe my uneasiness might be taking Sibyl off her game as well."
    C "(I'm making this even harder for her... I have to calm down.)"
    "I try my hardest to sit still and calm my racing heart, but when I finally feel Sibyl's fingers against my cheeks, I cannot help but jump."
    S "Are you alright?"
    C "Sorry, your fingers are just a little cold."
    S "You do feel warm."
    "Pausing for the moment, Sibyl rubs her hands together vigorously to warm them up, then reaches out to start touching my face again."
    "It's embarrassing and a totally weird feeling, the way she pulls and pods at my face this way and that, trying to feel the curves and contours of my face."
    C "(Is she going to mold the clay or mold my face?)"
    "When she withdraws her hands for the first time to mold her clay, it suddenly feels even more strange to {b}not{/b} have her hands working into my skin."
    C "(It was a good idea at least even if it didn't work out, Miss Izzie.)"
    "I still have no idea if my teacher really expected one of her students to strip down and fondle another, but she sure seemed enthusiastic about it."
    "If the roles were reversed, I imagine that I could maybe try my luck in touching places that I don't normally get to touch, but from this perspective I don't have a clue what that would mean."
    "As Sibyl returns to rubs her hands all around my face and down my neck, my eyes are drawn to her face. Her expression remains still and focused, much like when she works on her other art projects."
    C "(She's so close!)"
    "Even though the project goal is to sculpt by feel, Sibyl still puts her large blue eyes to work inspecting how my flesh reacts to probing by her fingers."
    "Her face is so incredibly close that I can smell her shampoo, and my heartbeat once again starts running into overdrive."
    C "(Her lips! Ahh, I want to kiss her!)"
    "Its right before me, that soft pink pout. I could lean just a {b}little{/b} closer and touch her lips with my own."
    C "(Should I kiss her? Would she freak out? Can I play it off an an accident? God, why does this have to be so difficult?)"
    "A multitude of thoughts in a similar fashion continue to play through my mind, devolving rapidly with my mental state."
    C "(Sibyl so close! Is the mood \"right\" now? I'm going to do it!)"
    "I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing but I can feel the opportunity slipping away quickly right before my eyes."
    C "(I'm going to kiss her, and then play it off real smooth... or maybe I should just tell her I love her right now?)"
    "I feel warm already, my heart coursing blood fast and strong through my body. Jitters return to my limbs as I try to hype myself up to do something risky and incredible."
    "And then Sibyl stops touching me to return to her clay. My single-minded focus breaks intensity, and for the first time I notice both Tanya and Miss Izzie together stealthily watching from across the room."
    "Tanya has her arms crossed like she's sulking and sports an equally dark expression when she catches my line of sight, while Miss Izzie beside her flashes a peace sign at me when I look her way."
    S "I'm almost done the basic shape of the head and shoulders. How are you holding up, Clover?"
    C "Oh, umm, pretty good. Thanks."
    "I'm not at all \"pretty good\", but I can't exactly tell her that I was just about to surprise kiss her a few moments ago."
    "Now that I know I have an audience, and remember that I'm still in the middle of art class, I just can't bring myself to attempt it anymore."
    C "(I'm sorry, Miss Izzie, I don't know what you intended for me to do but I just couldn't do it.)"
    "I thought I was going to be able to make Sibyl fall for me naturally, just like how she charmed me so easily, but now I realize that may not work out so well."
    C "(Maybe I've been a little naive in thinking she would just automatically fall in love with me if I try to surround her with my affection.)"
    "Vittoria and Vincenza warned me that Sibyl wouldn't be so easy to win over, and now Miss Izzie told me the same thing."
    C "({b}Bold{/b}. I need to be {b}confident{/b}.)"
    "The whole setup by Miss Izzie ultimately does not result in any real progress with Sibyl, but what it does do is harden my resolve to be make Sibyl {b}mine{/b}, by any means necessary."

    S "I... I {b}knew{/b} you liked me, okay?"
    C "You... what?"
    S "I already kind of... suspected you had these feelings for me, but didn't know how to react. I guess I just hoped I could ignore it and it would go away."
    C "(So I went through all the trouble to try to seduce her, and she was purposely ignoring it every time!?)"
    "Sibyl was hoping my feelings would just \"subside\" so she wouldn't have to face a difficult conversation like this."
    "At the same time, I was hoping I could just keep pushing it further until she finally returned my feelings."
    "It's with a dark humor that I feel like we're both two rotten peas in a pod."
    "I don't want to think that I'm putting all the blame on her, however. They're my feelings that I selfishly pushed on her, and caused her strife as a result."
    C "(Just like Tanya warned me about...)"
    C "I'm... sorry too. I never meant to cause you all this emotional torment over my own clumsy feelings."
    C "I guess I really messed up too, thinking that maybe if I pushed a little harder you might fall for me eventually."
    S "I'm straight, Clover. I've told you about my plans for the future and I mean to make them come true."
    "Sibyl's \"plans\" — her husband, children, big foster family cottage, and all that stuff she spoke to me so dreamily about before."
    C "Why can't those plans be with someone like me? Someone like... you know, a woman?"
    "The whole exclusionary concept seems like a slap to the face. One one level I know there's a very realistic reason that she cannot accept a woman."
    "But on another level, I just cannot stand that something as dumb as being born with same same lady parts should stand in the way of my feelings now."
    C "How do you know if you've never tried it!?"
    "I regret saying it the moment it leaves me lips, but after the initial wave of regret passes, my own burning anger makes the guilt subside."
    S "How do {b}you{/b} know you like me?"
    "Sibyl hits me with a hard question which I struggle to find a satisfactory answer for."
    C "(I haven't really \"tried it\" myself either, have I? But I know my feelings are more than mere infatuation.)"
    "I don't even have to say my reply aloud. I can tell that Sibyl knows I have no logical reasoning for feeling the way I do about her."
    "It's a bitter silence that follows. Though we've exchanged many words, few of them have led to anything meaningful."
    C "So what do we do now? We both apologized."
    S "You're my Vertu partner and my {b}friend{/b}, Clover, so it pains me to ask this of you, but..."
    S "{b}Please{/b} give up on me."
    "The metaphorical force of her words hits strongly even knowing this whole time that I wouldn't walk away from this encounter smiling."
    C "(How does she expect me to just... \"stop loving her\" that easily? Or is she asking me to bury it deep down like Tanya?)"
    C "You're right. That's a terrible thing to ask of me."
    S "Clover, I'm sorry that—"
    "Sibyl starts with an obvious means to lend me some small amount of comfort through her gentle words but I cut her off immediately."
    C "So I'm going to ask something terrible of you too. I want you to kiss me."
    S "C-Clover...!"
    "I can barely believe I'm saying it, but I do. I don't know whether it's a vindictive request or merely my selfishness coming to the fore."
    C "That's the proof of what we're both saying, isn't it? If you find you like it, then that proves your future can include a girl like me."
    "I know that everything I'm saying is total crap, but either because Sibyl only sees the good side of my intentions or not, she stuns me by accepting."
    S "One kiss."
    C "O-Okay!"
    S "No tongue."
    C "Of c-course..."
    "Sibyl steps closer to me, looking me directly in the eye. I stare back, suddenly paralyzed by what is happening."
    C "(She's waiting for me to... {b}kiss{/b} her!)"
    "It honestly feels like this has to be some kind of cruel set-up, but there she stands before me blushing lightly with a serious yet awkward expression."
    "I shuffle forward a little and hold my arms out slightly, but find the position unsuitable somehow and retract myself shyly away from her."
    C "Have you... done this before?"
    S "You mean... kiss?"
    "I nod silently to the question, to which Sibyl shyly turns her head away."
    S "Yeah, I have."
    "The thought that someone else has already soiled Sibyl's lips, and a {b}boy{/b} no less, strikes a hot jealousy streak inside me, but I try to keep it down."
    "Perhaps seeing that I'm struggling so much with the kiss, Sibyl turns to sit on the edge of her bed beside us, and grabs my arm to pull me down beside her."
    S "It's just a kiss.."
    "Sibyl speaks to quietly that I cannot decide whether the statement is for my benefit or hers, and in a rush of guilt I remember once again how I'm the oe forcing her into this."
    "I have not a single thought of taking the request back, however."
    "My heart feels like it's going to jump out of my chest just sitting beside her, and when she brushes her bangs out of her face while turning toward me, I feel like I might just faint."
    S "Well...?"
    "I stiffly turn myself to face her and nudge myself a little closer but all I can think is that I hope she cannot smell the sweat pouring out all over my body with how close we are."
    C "(I came {b}this{/b} far; I can't blow it {b}now{/b}!)"
    "Steeling myself, I push myself forward at her with all my strength and find that she leans slightly back away from me at the same time. Shocked and hurt, I cannot help but immediately call out."
    C "You moved away—!"
    S "You {b}lunged{/b} at me!"
    "We both reset again but my anxiety doesn't abate. I place my hand romantically on her knee as I lean in closer but her bright blue eyes staring back at me shatter my resolve."
    "A soft frown form at Sibyl's lips and for a fraction of a second I think I've lost the moment altogether, but then her hand reaches out quickly toward my cheek."
    "In another moment my vision is full of Sibyl's face from way closer than I ever remember, and almost on instinct I close my eyes to lose myself in the feeling of her "
