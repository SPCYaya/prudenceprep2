    "Following our late-night date, my worries about the impending end of the school year seem to melt away, to be replaced with a cautious optimism for a future that yet remains uncertain."
    mw "Wild Roses, huddle up!"
    "Standing side-by-side with Tanya under the bright lights of an early evening lacrosse home game, and with Miss Woolsey's pep talk rousing my blood, I feel like I can take on everything — including the girls of Quabbin Charter."
    mw "This my be our second to last game of the season, but it's our last at home. We've got a strong crowd tonight so I want you all to get out there and give your friends in the bleachers something to cheer about! Who's with me?"
    "Cheering, we all throw our hands into the circle with Miss Woolsey. The hand beside me rests just a little more heavily on mine than the others, and I turn to face Tanya beside me to share an excited grin."
    "{b}WILD ROSES!{/b}"
    "Tanya runs off to join the starters on the field, while I take my seat to wait my turn at the sidelines. I use the time to scout the Quabbin Charter players as the game finally begins."
    C "(What do they feed these girls!?)"
    "Their team is big, and strong. Tanya is big and strong too, but then these girls are enormous and move way faster than I feel they have any right to considering their size."
    "One of their defenders in particular is a mountain — tall, bulky, and mean. She might not be able to move as quickly as the others, but from her position on defense she tears up our attacking squad with her size, reach, and force."
    C "(She may be an un-moveable mountain by the goal, but me and Tanya are so in sync with each other that we can definitely find a way around her!)"
    "As if she hears my thoughts, Miss Woolsey swaps me in as her first choice substitution."
    C "That defender is really something."
    T "Yeah..."
    "I catch up to Tanya out on the field as the rest of the changes happen. She exchanges a quick conversation with me despite how hard she's breathing after running her butt off even more than most games."
    C "Let's pass around her, just like the long pass we did before. Get free from her and I'll lob it up."
    "A whistle blows from the sidelines, drawing both of our attention, but we turn back to face each other with enough time for Tanya to give me a sharp nod."
    "Drops of sweat flick off her flushed face with the motion, a sight which arouses more than just my competitive spirit."
    "Just knowing that my girlfriend is out there playing with me keeps the aching tiredness away from my limbs. My eyes glue to Tanya with every spare moment, just waiting for the right moment."
    "Finally, as I win the ball coming off a down the field charge from Quabbin's offensive squad, I catch eyes with Tanya way up the field in prime position."
    C "(Now's our chance!)"
    "I cry out my girlfriend's name in my head as I wind up a pass from deep down the midfield, whipping the ball over the other team's forwards and right into Tanya's crosse."
    C "(She's got it!)"
    "I pump my first as I watch Tanya pivot to find her next pass to our offensive team, but the big, large Quabbin girl is on her quickly, blocking her passing lanes and getting up in her face."
    "My frustrations to see our plan falter at her stubborn defense release as a growl as I trot up the field to support. It's not just me frustrated, clearly, as the defender keeps Tanya from passing but can't dispossess her."
    C "C'mon, Tanya, she doesn't have half the skills you have!"
    "My encouragement seems to work on Tanya, but only makes the Quabbin girl more ferocious as well."

    "Ultimately, she puts her size to use, sneaking in a slash of the stick that hits against Tanya's arm, and which the official doesn't catch."
    "I yell it out loud and point toward the offender, and so do many of my teammates, but the official does nothing. What should have ended there only continues, with the defender not giving up."
    "Perhaps emboldened by getting away with a penalty already, the defender attempts another risky poke check to try to knock the ball free."
    "She only succeeds in whacking her crosse against Tanya's face, stunning her briefly, but with enough time that she has no hope of trying to block a nasty follow-up cross check that sends her tumbling hard face-first into the grass below."
    C "{b}Tanya!{/b}"
    "My girlfriend lies still in the dirt for far too long. My heart thumps so heavily in my chest that it feels like it'll explode out, and I take off running toward where Tanya crumpled on ground atop the torn up grass and dirt."
    "I'm not the first to make it to her side. By the time I arrive, Tanya's already helped up into sitting position on the field.d I'm happy to see her eyes open and a consciousness present in her face."
    C "Tanya, are you alright? Tanya?"
    "Even so, her gaze is unfocused, her limbs appearing heavy as she holds them. She tries to stand but only stumbles forward again to be caught by me and Coach Woolsey within the huddle of our teammates surrounding Tanya."

    "While I'm still brushing grass out fo Tanya's hair, the officials's whistle blows loudly in my ears, and I catch a flash of yellow between her fingers."
    C "{b}Yellow!?{/b}"
    "My head whips angrily toward the official so fast that my braided blonde pigtails cut through the air like golden chains that bounce off my shoulders."
    "Leaving the dazed Tanya to Miss Woolsey's capable arms, I let off on the official about her missed call in a fury, my words more fast-paced angry rambling than anything that makes coherent sense. She knows what I'm angry about regardless."
    "In another moment, I'm pushed right up to the defender herself, still nearby and mourning the yellow card she received dismissively, not even looking after Tanya as she gets walked to the edge of the field."
    C "Hey, you, Quabbin girl, get over here!"
    "I grab both ends of my stick and push out at her, which she brushes off under the watchful eye of the official. After already getting another, she's not going to risk getting another and being ejected from the game with a red card."
    player "Back off!"
    C "Say you're sorry! Say you're sorry right {b}freaking{/b} now!"
    player "If you're so afraid of getting hurt, then you shouldn't be playing the game."
    "I don't care that this girl towers over me, or that she probably eats three times more yogurt and oats a day than I do."
    "I'm seeing red, and I don't mean the card that the official throws up when I cross check my target again, this time hard enough to make even her stumble backward."
    C "I'll show you \"getting hurt\"! You can't just hurt Tanya— hurt {b}my girlfriend{/b}, and get away with it!"
    player "Maybe \"your girlfriend\" shouldn't have been such a pushover?"
    "The officials and members of the Quabbin team get between us before I can take any more whacks at the girl locked in my sight. To my surprise and delight, some pink uniforms come up too to brush against the Quabbin girls rushing in."
    "The teams are separated quickly while I storm off toward the edge of the field among, as I suddenly realize, a swell of cheering from the crowd."

    C "(They're cheering for me?)"
    "Rather than be afraid like the old Clover of the past, I glance up at the rows of pink uniforms and fear none of their faces. Instead, their encouragement lifts my spirits, and I shrug off the watchful official to trot back to Tanya."

    "The frightening words are shared between me and my teacher despite neither of us saying them aloud."
    mi "I can take her to the nurse. You've still got a game to win, coach. Give me a hand here, Clover."
    "I do not hesitate to heft Tanya's weight onto my shoulder and hold her closely around the waist, but I do certainly cringe at the directive for everything that it implies."
    "Images of the flashing red card return to swim in my mind, followed swiftly by the horror of everything that means for both me and the team."
    "The grim reality of the situation I've put everyone in is clear on the creased lines above Coach Woolsey's furrowed brow, but those soften away with just a quick exchange of words."

    "I stand right next to the bed and hold Tanya's hand while she jabbers at me in Chinese, but am quickly enough shooed away by the nurse who insists that what Tanya needs most is undisturbed rest and not my clammy palm."
    "Tanya seems to very much disagree with her based on the tone with which she starts speaking, but as much as it pains me to leave her now when she clearly wants me to stay, I'd rather she get better quickly under the nurse's supervision."

    C "I sure hope so, or I'd better start learning Chinese."
    C "(Like I could ever learn Chinese. I'm barely passing beginner French.)"
    C "I really screwed up this time, didn't I?"
    "It takes a moment for Miss Izzie to realize what I'm getting at, and when she finally does come to reason, she doesn't hesitate to tell me how wrong I am."
    mi "What you did out there today was totally hard-core! That Quabbin defender came right after Tanya and you let her have it."
    mi "That's exactly what a girlfriend should do! Tanya's probably going to go absolutely crazy on you once she's out of the nurse's office!"
    mi "You heard the student section go up in applause, didn't you? They cheered you right off the field! Listen, Clover, no one thinks you did anything wrong!"
    "Miss Izzie does her thing, reaching up to ruffle my hair in reassurance, but this also fails to achieve the results she must have been hoping for."
    C "...The official thought I was in the wrong."
    C "The other girl played it cool and got away with a yellow, but I let my anger get the best of me and got thrown out of the game."
    C "Now I won't be able to play next game. I'll miss the final game of the season, and probably Tanya will too. Our midfield was already weak, and now it'll be even worse."
    C "I've let myself down. I've let Miss Woolsey down, again, for the bajillionth time. And now I've gone and let the whole team down too."
    "My head drops low, my gaze blurring out at the floor tiles below until I see Miss Izzie's sandals come into view and feel her hands grip just below my shoulders."
    "Before I can ask her what she's doing, my body starts shaking back and forth as hard as her little body can manage. I feel almost like I've been turned into one of the spray paint cans in her store room."
    mi "Snap out of it, Clover! It's okay to make mistakes. As far as your mistake goes, it's barely even a rounding error. It's like the \"minus one point for spelling error in an essay\" type of error: totally inconsequential."
    mi "God knows I've done worse than smack around some uppity— Err, what I mean is, life's a huge pile of shit sometimes. You can either roll around and wallow in it or you can grab a shovel and start tossing it away bit by bit."
    "It's clear enough that Miss Izzie is no therapist, nor a guidance councilor, nor anyone at all that has any qualification to give advice, but she's trying her best and actually getting through somewhat."
    S "What did I just walk into?"
    "Out of stage left appears Sibyl suddenly, cheeks tinted pink with the same soft flush of exertion I've seen on her face after running too hard in gym class. Miss Izzie finally quits shaking me at the same time."
    C "Sibyl!"
    mi "A pep talk, that's what! Take it from here, Sibyl. My job is done."
    "Miss Izzie disappears just as quickly as she does in art class, her short legs carrying her away now that my emotional self has been somehow stabilized and transferred into the care of my Vertu partner."
    S "How is Tanya?"
    "Sibyl breaks the ice quietly, turning to look at the doorway behind which lies Tanya, then back to me expectantly."
    C "The nurse says it's a mild concussion and the best thing we can do for her is let her get some rest to recover."
    S "That is good to hear."
    "Taking a step forward, Sibyl takes one of my hands into her own probably so that I can't escape her as I'd done so many times before when I first started at the academy."
    S "How are {b}you{/b}, Clover?"
    "The question brings me to pause for a moment. It shouldn't be a surprise that Sibyl, who has long ago already shown a supernatural understanding of my emotions better than I have, should know I'm having problems at the current moment."
    "She doesn't know any of the particulars of course, so I fill her in on what red cards mean in lacrosse, and how in addition to being thrown out of the game today, that I won't be able to participate in the next and final game either."
    "Much of the same points which Miss Izzie brought up are once again reiterated by Sibyl, though in a much more gentle manner."
    S "That Quabbin player was in the wrong, Clover. I was angry too. She hurt Tanya, my friend, and your—"
    "Sibyl pauses, probably not quite sure exactly how things stand between me and Tanya at the moment, and not wanting to make a mistake in such a sensitive moment. I helpfully finish for her."
    C "Girlfriend."
    S "Your {b}girlfriend{/b}, Clover. Even if what you did was \"wrong\", no one can possibly fault you for sticking up for her."
    "Listening to Sibyl try to comfort me, I distinctly feel like this is an \"I'm not mad, I'm disappointed\" speech like my parents would give.s)"

    "My quarry remains exactly where I left her in the small bed the nurse uses to treat her patients. I find her awake and staring back at me blankly with her deep, dusky eyes."
    C "Oh, you're awake. You didn't answer when I knocked at the door. How are you feeling?"
    "I trot gaily up to Tanya with a relieved smile, but in a manner which quickly turns worrisome when she only follows me silently with her eyes upon approach and fails to greet me at all."
    T "Who... are you?"
    "The timid question shocks me numb, making me take a physical step back away from the bed while my emotions run teh gamut from shock to fear and finally home to despair."
    C "(Tanya, my girlfriend... {b}doesn't even remember me{/b}!)"
    "The terrifying reality of the moment leaves me paralyzed and stuck unable to decide what I should do."
    "I could wait for the nurse to arrive and probably tell me that this is a symptom of her concussion which will hopefully pass, but I could also run back to my room, dive back into my bed, and try waking up for real this time."
    "The latter option increasingly feels like my best hope, but just as my muscles are warming up to sprint all the way back to the dorms, the vacuous expression on Tanya's face slowly begins fill in once more."
    T "Clover, I don't have amnesia. I was only playing a prank on you."
    "The color which had quickly drained out of my face returns just as swiftly, but goes even further as I turn red with anger."
    "Without a single word, I jump atop the nurse's bed to straddle my knees on either side of Tanya and reach out to grab at Tanya's uniform by the collar."
    C "When I'm through with you, you're going to wish that girl had sent you to a hospital out of my reach..."
    "The fury in my voice is no doubt as evident as the darkness of the expression plainly visible across my face."
    T "W-Wait, Clover, I'm sorry, I—"
    "Tanya pleads forgiveness for her callous little trick, but that doesn't stop me from yanking her upper body toward me by her collar and pressing the hardest, most angry kiss against her lips, then dropping her back against the pillow."
    "With a huff, I sit back on the bed and try to let me relief that Tanya recognizes me and seems to be perfectly normal outweigh my anger from the little stunt she pulled."
    "Tanya remains stunned by my vengeance for a few moments longer before apologizing once again."
    T "Sorry, really Clover, I'm so sorry. I woke up when you knocked and didn't wasn't really all the way there yet when you walked in, and groggy me though it would be a funny prank."
    "I glare at Tanya silently from across the bed, but the relief at hearing Tanya's voice form words I can actually understand once again evaporates most of the anger in short order."
    C "You really scared me, Tanya. You went all crazy yesterday after you got bowled over on the field and I was really worried about you."
    T "I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
    C "You deserve a {b}way{/b} worse punishment than the one you just got."
    T "If that was my punishment, then I will regretfully accept more... after I'm fully cleared for rough play."
    "Climbing off the bed, I pull up a chair to sit next to Tanya where it will be comfortable for both of us."
    C "What do you mean?"
    C "(With Tanya speaking English and being a total meanie, she seems all but back to normal already.)"
    T "I still have a little brain fog right now, but the nurse that should clear up with as my brain heals. She instructed me not t do anything stressful in mind or body for a few days."
    C "So... no lacrosse."
    T "No lacrosse. No classes. Just sleeping in my bed."
    C "That sounds amazing."
    T "It sounds like I'm going to be bored out of my mind at best."
    C "\"At best\"?"
    T "At worst, I'll be bored out of my mind while also stuck inside with Sierra {b}all day{/b}."
    C "I'll visit you whenever I can, I promise!"
    "Rather than reply right away, Tanya cants her head slightly to smile my direction, then slips a hand free from under the bed sheets to find my own."
    T "I'd love that, Clover."
    "Tanya may have only been expressing how much she appreciates me visiting her while she's unwell, but the way she looks into my eyes while tenderly holding my hand makes me feel that \"L\" word might have just as well been used more directly."
    C "(Maybe Tanya isn't actually completely back to normal after all...?)"
    "It could just be the concussion making her more amorous than normal, I think, but the warm jitters raising the hair all the way from where her hand touches mine to the back of my neck is not at all unwelcome."
    C "(Maybe Miss Izzie wasn't so wrong about Tanya...)"
    T "I must have been totally out of it mentally at the time because I don't remember much at all, but Na— Coach Woolsey told me all about what you did in that game."
    C "She told you about my red card?"
    "My expression droops so quickly I feel like my face might just drip off my skull, but Tanya's warm smile cheers me right back up."
    T "Yes, but also what you did to earn it. Thank you, Clover."
    C "But now I won't be able to play in the final game. I let my emotions get the better of me and the whole team suffers for it. Isn't that what you're always telling me off about?"
    T "Maybe you were way too selfish in the past, but now your first thought is how you've let down the team and not how you personally won't be able to win glory by playing in the final game."
    T "You've changed so much, Clover. To think I used to hate you so much, and now..."
    "Tanya's gaze lowers to a simmer yet again, and her hand tugs gently at mine, leading me toward her. Butterflies emerge from their cocoons and go mad trying to escape my stomach."
    C "Wait, is this okay? Don't you still need to rest?"
    "A soft pout crosses Tanya's lips, now so very close to mine, but it clears immediately."
    T "The nurse doesn't have to know."
    "Never ever in my life so far as anything been quite so sensual as that moment, half leaning over the infirmary bed, staring into Tanya's impassioned face."
    "I can {b}feel{/b} the desire radiating off her. It does not abate once our lips make contact, instead only amplifying in intensity with an ardent squeeze of her fingers through mine."

    "A whole gaggle of girls push through the doorway after the nurse. Each and every one of them are fellow Wild Roses coming to shower their best wishes upon Tanya, and most amazingly tell me how cool I was too."
    C "(So they're not mad at me for that whole incident?)"
    "Rather than be angry at me for getting thrown out of the game, it is my surprise and great pleasure to find they are instead happy that I stood up for Tanya and the rest of the team against the charter school bullies."

    C "Sibyl, thank you!"
    "Small tears well up in my eyes, and though Tanya jokes that I'm more happy to see breakfast arrive than to find her recovering well, I think we both know Im just so touched to have my life going so amazingly well."
    "I scarf down my breakfast without any delay of course, but it is mostly how happy to be surrounded by Tanya and Sibyl that makes me emotional. Even Sierra manages to shut up long enough to be the dutiful Vertu partner for Tanya."

    T "I asked if we could use this space to relax, eat some snacks, and take it easy for a little bit. We haven't had a lot of time to just \"be together\" in a while, and may not soon with finals coming up."
    C "That sounds fun! So is this, like, you guys' \"club room\"? Is this where you've been going every Saturday afternoon?"
    "I've been playing it cool, but I actually am kind of super curious about the whole \"cabal\" thing, and now seems like as good an opportunity as any to ask."
    T "We usually meet somewhere bigger... but yeah, this is kind of like a club room. These books are all the personal collection of the founder, but she lets us read them too."
    C "And they're all {i}baihe{/i}?"
    T "Mostly {i}yuri{/i}, actually. \"Baihe\" is Chinese and \"yuri\" is Japanese."
    C "Uh huh..."
    "I'm already getting lost with the explanation, but all the covers with two girls holding hands, embracing, and staring with such passion into one another's faces is difficult to misinterpret."
    "Scanning through some of the titles, which are mostly in Japanese text, I spot one with some English text printed alongside the loopy Japanese characters on the colorful cover illustration."
    C "This one says {b}Wildrose{/b}, like our lacrosse team!"
    "I start to pull it out from the shelf, but Tanya quickly pushes her hand atop mine to sink it deeply back into place between two other volumes."
    T "You're ready for that one yet."
    C "What do you mean, \"I'm not ready\"?"
    "I try to get an answer out of Tanya but she remains unusually evasive, so I let myself instead be coaxed by her into sharing a cozy-looking bean bag chair."
    "I sit my butt into the depths first. For a moment I believe with some trepidation that I might never escape this legume-filled contraption, but after Tanya sits atop my lap and lets me squeeze my arms around her midsection, that's just fine by me."
    T "I picked up an English volume of {i}Umibe no Kaze{/i}. That's the anime we were talking about just before."
    C "Didn't you say you already read it though?"
    T "I don't mind, and besides, you'll have to do the reading anyway. I still get pretty bad headaches when I concentrate on text too long."
    "I start reading the book mostly as an excuse to rest my head upon Tanya's shoulder and keep my arms around her while I hold it out in front of both of us, but as I work through the first volume I start getting drawn into the story for real."
    "This particular \"yuri\" is about an office worker who gets completely fed up with her job and runs away on the first boat to a small resort island, where she meets and spends the night with a local island resort worker."
    C "Whoa—! Did she really...?"
    "Pausing a moment between the end of one chapter and the next, I flip back and forth between the two pages. The former left off with them kissing together, and the latter with both of them waking up naked in bed."
    T "Did she what?"
    C "She just met that woman, like, two hours before and they're already in bed together!"
    "Tanya begins to giggle a little bit at my exclamations, to which I respond by pinching and tugging at her cheek until she stops."
    T "I told you that you weren't ready for that other book."
    "After finishing another volume of the series, my arms start to grow tired from holding up the books so far from my face and I instead settle into a quiet happiness squeezing my arms around Tanya in my lap like she's a living, breathing body pillow."
    C "(Her core is so strong and firm. Does she do a lot of crunches and planks when I'm not looking?)"
    "Tanya, with her head resting back and rolled over my shoulder, seems just about to nod off completely due to the lull in activity, giving me ample time to appreciate the graceful curves of her face and delicate black stalks of her eyelashes."
    C "Hey, Tanya. I'm going to go home for the summer — to wherever that may be."
    T "Hmm?"
    "Somehow, despite sleeping all day, Tanya still accumulates enough drowsiness that she needs to shake it off herself when I suddenly start talking again."
    C "I said I'm going to go back home once the school year ends. I don't know what \"home\" I'll be going back to, but it's probably time that I get some closure on how things went down."
    C "I need to re-build my relationship with both of my parents. We call and chat but it still feels like there's a distance. I don't know anything about their lives now that they're apart."
    "Tanya is quiet for a moment, but soon enough agrees with me on the matter."
    T "That sounds like a tough situation, Clover. I hope everything goes well."
    C "Yeah, I think it'll be pretty hard..."
    C "That's why I want you to come with me."
    T "Clover?"
    "Abandoning our soft, heads-literally-next-to-each-other whisper tone, Tanya jumps with surprise, her head rising off my shoulder to face me squarely."
    C "Only if you want to, of course... and it doesn't have to be {b}all{/b} summer."
    C "I know you're going to be here at the academy for the break instead of going home to your family in Singapore. I though that maybe... you could come live with me, and my parents, for even just a little bit of it."
    C "It may be a little selfish, but part of me is afraid that \"this\" will end if we're apart too long, and I don't want that."
    T "I don't want \"this\" to end either, Clover — not over the summer, not next year, and not the year after that."
    C "So you're going to break up with me two years from now? Wow, okay..."
    "Tanya turns in her seat atop my lap, curling up to squeeze into the bean bag chair beside me, our heads pressed together by the sinking embrace of the seat."
    "She smiles at me, so sweetly, while our foreheads rub together and our noses stick out against one another. The mood is just right, but just before we sink into one another's lips yet again, a sharp pinch makes me side flinch painfully."
    C "Yowch!"
    T "Don't even joke about breaking up with me."

    "As I watch Sibyl return to her packing, I cannot help but think how lonely she, who comes from such a large family, must have been before I arrived."

    C "(Well, friend to Sibyl and Tanya anyway. I barely spoke to anyone but them, and the other lacrosse girls too I guess.)"
    "\"I meant every word when I told you that the people you'd meet at this academy would one day become like a second family. As I've watched you, Tanya, and Sibyl over the past months, I hope you understand that now.\""
    "\"Enjoy your summer, Clover. Next year is sure to be even more special than the last!\""
    S "Miss Woolsey wrote a lot in your yearbook, didn't she? She's so thoughtful."
    C "Were you able to get your yearbook signed by Miss Izzie yet?"
    S "Oh yeah. She filled almost a third of the page all by herself."
    "Sibyl props up her yearbook to show me the long scrawling comments left by her club advisor, reaching such a length that the lines start to droop to one side as it goes on and on."
    S "She basically recapped the entire year, told me how creative I am over and over again, begged me to watch over you and Tanya, and ended by noting that I have the fluffiest hair in class."
    C "That sounds like her."
    "I try to not make my comment sound too demeaning, and luckily Sibyl doesn't take it that way."
    S "She sure is a wild woman, but also a {b}lot{/b} of fun, and really knows her stuff. It's like she was born to be an art teacher."
    C "Yeah, I know what you mean. Miss Woolsey is a natural coach. She's the kindest and most supportive woman in the world, but she can be tough too."
    "Memories of the incident in the locker room come to mind, as well as the endless hours she spent drilling us in this very room or out in the hot sun."
    S "We're so lucky to have both of them."
    C "Did you manage to get all the other signatures you wanted? Rachel passed me earlier."
    S "I think so, and yeah, I got her already. What about you? Are you missing any?"
    C "I sill need Tanya."
    "Both of us turn to glance her way, finding her now chatting at length with Miss Woolsey, her yearbook already signed. They both glance my way briefly in the course of their discussion."
    S "I think they're talking about you."
    C "Y-You think?"
    "Just knowing that they're talking about me drives me mildly crazy, but I manage to resist the overwhelming urge to ask Tanya what Miss Woolsey had said about me when she returns and mentions nothing of it."
    T "Got all your signatures?"
    S "Yup!"
    C "I have one left."
    "It's a relief to me when Tanya doesn't reply at all, instead reaching her right hand up to brush her fingers through her hair. She knows exactly who I'm missing."
    C "(So she's also fretting about what she'll write in my yearbook.)"
    "As the bulk of the yearbook signing frenzy has settled, groups of students have retired with friends to sit in blobs on the bleachers. The three of us see no reason to not do the same."
    "Tanya and I trade yearbooks, then both flip to an open page and look down toward it. Her pen clicks after only a short delay, but my pink glitter gel never gets closer than a hair's breadth from the paper."
    C "(It's hard enough to summarize everything that's happened between me and Tanya in the time I've known her, let alone knowing that this'll be the all-time {b}permanent record{/b} of this moment.)"
    "I search for some inspiration in glancing above the edge of the yearbook at Tanya. Her head is down, hand sliding back and forth across the page of my yearbook in the midst of writing."
    C "(Hurry up, Clover! Tanya's already, like, a whole paragraph in and you haven't written a single word!)"
    "A small victory comes in writing down one word to start off with. \"Tanya,\"."
    C "(It's a start!)"
    "My inspiration ends there, while I spy Tanya's deep brown eyes still trailing back and forth across my own yearbook with each line. Her sleek black hair falls down across her face in such a way that she has to pause to swipe it back over her ear."
    C "(It's not fair! I can't put everything I'm feeling into words! I can't even take my eyes off of Tanya long enough to start!)"
    T "And... done! Almost finished, Clover?"
    "Tanya's pen clicks closed. Her bright smile weighs on me, knowing that she's managed to do exactly what I'm struggling with."
    C "J-Just a moment..."
    "My eyes scan over Tanya's name glittering in pink where I wrote it. In the moment, I reach for the right words to symbolize all the days we've spent quarreling, flirting, and pushing one another forward together."
    "\"Tanya,\""
    "\"I love you.\""
    C "Here."
    "I pass the yearbook back with subtly trembling hands that I pray she cannot see, and receive my own in return."
    T "Are we... going to read them now?"
    C "If you want..."
    "A sigh forms in my chest as a physical manifestation of my half-formed belief that Tanya will surely dump me after failing to write anything good in her book. I crack my own to find her own long message."
    "\"Remember that time we started shoving each other in gym class and you fell on top of me? I thought I was going to die. Not because you were going to kill me, but because I realized at that moment just how much I liked you.\""
    C "(I got so nervous I couldn't write, and Tanya was so nervous she started word vomiting. Glad I'm not the only one bad at this.)"
    "\"I like you a whole lot, Clover. So much that I think about you every day. Sometimes I think there's—\""
    T "Clover!"
    C "Huh?"
    "I'm still only just scraping the surface of the rambling love letter Tanya left in my yearbook when I hear her call my name, and look up in just enough time to prepare myself for the compressive force of her arms thrown around me, yearbook still in her hand."
    C "Tanya, you're crushing me with your gorilla arms!"
    T "I love you too, Clover."
    "The flutter of Tanya's shining obsidian hair tickles my neck, but even that cannot compare to how much her words tickle at my heart."
    C "(Seems like she enjoyed what I wrote in her yearbook. I win this one, Tanya!)"
    "The display of affection draws the attention of several students nearby us, but it's only when our lips press together that a chorus of \"ooh\"s erupt. Even Sibyl joins in with the crowd."
    "Under normal circumstances, I feel like I'd want to die, but this is no normal circumstance."
    C "(Let them watch.)"

    "At the far end of the long lane to the academy, Tanya and I wait patiently side by side, hand in hand."
    "For the longest time we merely enjoy each others' quiet company, but soon enough I sneeze, and after blessing me for it, Tanya returns to say yet more."
    T "If you don't exercise over the break, you're going to get fat."
    "Tanya earns a push of my palm against her forehead for that remark — delivered with my left hand as my right is still held securely in her left. I let her off easy because I know it's true."
    C "I think I've eaten enough yogurt parfaits for a lifetime. I deserve a break."
    T "You didn't have to eat them everyday just because I did."
    C "{b}Now{/b} you tell me!?"
    "We've already seen Sibyl off, so now it's just me, Tanya, and my big duffel at the end of the academy drive waiting for my ride to show."
    "Summery heat bears down heavily on us even in the shade of the tall trees lining the long drive, but neither of us finds any urgency to separate our sweaty hands until the very moment my rideshare driver pulls up."
    "I shove my duffel in the trunk with a great deal of difficulty, then turn back to Tanya waiting nearby for just one more kiss to tide us over until we meet again."
    T "See you soon, Clover."
    C "See you soon, Tanya."
    "Whether a trick of the light or the heart, the lush foliage which blurs together as I speed away from Tanya already seems to be fading from their cool verdant shades into the blazing hues of Autumn."
