    S "Do you really have to run her this hard so early in the morning?"
    T "This much is just to keep her skills sharp until her probation is over."
    S "But she looks like a fish lying on a dry pier."
    "From my vantage spread out on my back in the grass gasping for air, I probably do look like a fish out of water."
    "Determined to ease Sibyl's mind, and to get her to cease giving me such a pitying look, I manage to scrape myself back up onto aching legs once again."
    C "She's right, Sibyl. I can't allow myself to get complacent. I need to be on top of my game when probation expires, so it's hard training and clean, whole foods every day for me from here on out!"

    T "\"Clean, whole foods\", Clover. You promised."
    C "B-But..."
    S "Oh, just give her this one day, won't you, Tanya? She's literally been talking about them in her sleep."
    "Luckily for me, Tanya is just as weak to Sibyl's demands as I am, so I manage to get a full helping of crisp, warm, delicious churros despite Tanya's protests."
    C "Every day should be Cinco de Mayo."
    "THe kitchen staff has made churros a number of times before, but they go all out today with a special dish of {i}chilaquiles{/i} as the highlight of breakfast and even freshly made {i}horchata{/i} too."
    S "Look how happy she is! Doesn't she look like a rabbit, Tanya?"
    "The way that I attempt to savor the amount of churros I've allotted for myself by making lots of tny nibbles evidently just makes me an amusing sight for everyone else."
    "When I look up from my delicious fried treat, I catch a glimpse of even a small grin touching the corner of Tanya's lips."
    C "(Whatever. I'm not going to let looking a little funny get in the way of enjoying this Mexican feast to the fullest.)"

    "The sugar crash lands hard during the very first period after homeroom, but the lecture on quadratic equations is probably just as much at fault as the churros."
    "Sibyl manages to keep me at attention for most of the lecture, and when I start daydreaming about what Mexican food will be served during French lessons, Tanya doesn't hesitate to prod me in the back with her mechanical pencil."

    S "Maybe Tanya was right. You should have something more wholesome for lunch, Clover."
    C "Nonsense! If I work hard enough in gym class, I can eat whatever I want at lunch with a clean conscience!"
    T "Even if you will burn enough calories to make up for eating churros at three meals in the same day, that much sugar just plain isn't good for you."
    C "Don't you worry, I feel great! Check this out! I'm burning that big breakfast off right now to make room for lunch!"
    "Not only to do I show off jogging in place, but I do it a the same time as a carefully bounce a badminton shuttlecock up and down with my racket at the same time."
    "It's honestly only an accident when it takes an odd bounce off my racket and smacks Tanya right on her forehead."
    C "Sorry. Accident."
    "Sibyl takes a worried glance between me and Tanya, but rather than get angry, Tanya merely picks the shuttlecock off the ground and whips it right back at my face in return."
    T "Watch it, you dullard."
    C "Make me, you brute!"
    "Though we trade bards much as we have always done in the past, the malice just isn't there like it had been before. Even Sibyl is comfortable enough with the exchange now to smile through it."
    T "Watch it, or I will!"
    "We both trade throws pelting each other with the light plastic shuttlecock as Sibyl looks on until Miss Woolsey gives us a stern glare from across the gymnasium as if to say \"quick goofing off and get back to the lesson at hand\"."
    C "So anyway, Tanya, we still need to work on a plan to present to Miss Woolsey by the end of next week."
    T "I know, I've been thinking about it already. I have art club with Sibyl tomorrow, so maybe we can do some brainstorming on Friday?"
    C "Yeah, let's do that!"
    "A distracting motion catches the corner of my eye, which I find to be Sibyl nearby, silently twirling her racket in her hands as Tanya and I talk to one another. When I look her way, she shows me an encouraging smile that wasn't there a moment before."
    C "...And maybe we should do it in the library. Maybe Sibyl can find some books for us to reference."
    S "I'd be very happy to help if I can!"
    "It's at this mention that Sibyl step forward, the small smile now a full grin spread across her face."
    T "Miss Woolsey never said we couldn't enlist some outside help. Besides, you're basically part of the team anyway with how you're always spectating our practices and cheering on our games."
    S "That is exactly right!"
    "We quickly pick back up with our casual volley of the shuttlecock over the net stretched across the gym floor before Miss Woolsey catches us talking again, but all the while my thoughts are left on Sibyl."
    C "(Is she feeling... left out?)"
    "It's no overstatement to say that I'm maybe spending more time with Tanya now than I am with Sibyl, not counting the time we spend asleep in the same room."
    "It was Sibyl who encouraged me to join the lacrosse team and get closer to Tanya, and I don't think she is showing any regrets about that, but it also must be tough for her to have her two best friends share a hobby in which she cannot participate."

    "With Sibyl and Tanya at their art club on Thursday, I occupy the hours until meal time with the homework that's been piling up on my desk."
    "A fill-in-the-blank worksheet from science class sticks out among the rest, and I'm actually not that bad with biology, so it's with aplomb that I re-shuffle that sheet to the top of the stack to get to work."
    C "(Lipids. Mitochondria. Chloroplast.)"
    "Things go nice and smooth until I get deeper into the worksheet, to parts of lessons for which I may have been distracted with other drama in my life to remember all that well."
    C "(Cell cycle. I can do this. That's \"interphase\", \"mitosis\", \"telekinesis\"...)"
    "I happily flourish my pencil along the last letter of the last answer, but it becomes clear when checking over my work that maybe I have been more distracted lately than is good for me."
    C "(No, that's not right. Where are my notes on the cell cycle?)"
    "As I flip through my notebook, I fail to find any note about that lesson at all, and resort to having to open my textbook to find the right answers."
    C "(How did I manage to smash \"telophase\" and \"cytokinesis\" together?)"
    "With one worksheet finished and trigonometry peeking out behind it, I take the opportunity to stretch my legs instead with the excuse that sitting in one place too long is probably bad for my health after all."

    "My feet mindlessly lead me out the doors of the dormitory and, as best as I can tell, toward the school building likely in pursuit of where I know Sibyl and Tanya remain."
    "\"Psst. Clover.\""
    "I never make it far enough to reach the school building, however. A quiet summons snaps the background hum of outdoor activity on the academy's grounds, though I cannot find the source."
    "There's a moment when I turn my head toward the large statue in the garden where I think I must have instead fallen asleep rather than go for a walk, but realize it's the girl in pink uniform sitting at the base calling to me and not the Virgin Mary."
    C "What are {b}you{/b} doing here?"
    "A queer sensation comes over me as I approach Vincenza sitting under the statue's watchful vigil, which I quickly realize is because there isn't another girl sitting right beside her."
    C "(Is this some kind of trap? Is Vittoria going to jump me from the shadows?)"
    "I lean aside to peer around the back of the statue to find only yet more cheerfully colorful flowers smiling up at me from their earthen beds."
