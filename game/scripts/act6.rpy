    "Determined to ease Sibyl's mind, and to get her to cease giving me such a pitying look, I manage to scrape myself back up onto aching legs once again."

    S "Look how happy she is! Doesn't she look like a rabbit, Tanya?"
    "The way that I attempt to savor the amount of churros I've allotted for myself by making lots of tny nibbles evidently just makes me an amusing sight for everyone else."

    C "Nonsense! If I work hard enough in gym class, I can eat whatever I want at lunch with a clean conscience!"
    T "Even if you will burn enough calories to make up for eating churros at three meals in the same day, that much sugar just plain isn't good for you."
    C "Don't you worry, I feel great! Check this out! I'm burning that big breakfast off right now to make room for lunch!"
    "Not only to do I show off jogging in place, but I do it a the same time as a carefully bounce a badminton shuttlecock up and down with my racket at the same time."
    "It's honestly only an accident when it takes an odd bounce off my racket and smacks Tanya right on her forehead."
    C "Sorry. Accident."
    "Sibyl takes a worried glance between me and Tanya, but rather than get angry, Tanya merely picks the shuttlecock off the ground and whips it right back at my face in return."
    T "Watch it, you dullard."
    C "Make me, you brute!"
    "Though we trade bards much as we have always done in the past, the malice just isn't there like it had been before. Even Sibyl is comfortable enough with the exchange now to smile through it."
    T "Watch it, or I will!"
    "We both trade throws pelting each other with the light plastic shuttlecock as Sibyl looks on until Miss Woolsey gives us a stern glare from across the gymnasium as if to say \"quick goofing off and get back to the lesson at hand\"."
    C "So anyway, Tanya, we still need to work on a plan to present to Miss Woolsey by the end of next week."
    T "I know, I've been thinking about it already. I have art club with Sibyl tomorrow, so maybe we can do some brainstorming on Friday?"
    C "Yeah, let's do that!"
    "A distracting motion catches the corner of my eye, which I find to be Sibyl nearby, silently twirling her racket in her hands as Tanya and I talk to one another. When I look her way, she shows me an encouraging smile that wasn't there a moment before."
    C "...And maybe we should do it in the library. Maybe Sibyl can find some books for us to reference."
    S "I'd be very happy to help if I can!"
    "It's at this mention that Sibyl step forward, the small smile now a full grin spread across her face."
    T "Miss Woolsey never said we couldn't enlist some outside help. Besides, you're basically part of the team anyway with how you're always spectating our practices and cheering on our games."
    S "That is exactly right!"
    "We quickly pick back up with our casual volley of the shuttlecock over the net stretched across the gym floor before Miss Woolsey catches us talking again, but all the while my thoughts are left on Sibyl."
    C "(Is she feeling... left out?)"
    "It's no overstatement to say that I'm maybe spending more time with Tanya now than I am with Sibyl, not counting the time we spend asleep in the same room."
    "It was Sibyl who encouraged me to join the lacrosse team and get closer to Tanya, and I don't think she is showing any regrets about that, but it also must be tough for her to have her two best friends share a hobby in which she cannot participate."

    C "And... how do you feel about that?"

    C "I'm sure she has her reasons. I mean, if you're both close enough to have sex together with another girl... Well, I don't know exactly what to say about that, but you probably understand."
    O "Vittoria doesn't like to say \"have sex together\". She prefers \"have sex with the same girl\"."
    C "What's the difference?"
    O "Less guilt about us enjoying intimacy together."
    C "I don't get it. Just don't have sex with someone like me if you're going to feel guilty about it."

    "The nurse sighs dejectedly but does not fight Vittoria's wishes. Instead, she steps aside to allow me past her toward the bed where Vittoria lies pensively."

    H "So you came running to check on me? What wonderful juniors I have!"
    C "Y-Yeah..."
    "I really did intend to come in here and ask her the questions that Vincenza told me not to ask, but now that she's giving me this unintentional guilt trip it's hard to come out with it."
    C "She said something about your ankle?"
    H "Yes. We simply chased after the same tennis ball at the same time and ran right into one another! I took an odd step and this was the result."
    H "It is quite a minor injury. I will be back to my student council duties shortly, and in the mean time I have instructed Vincenza on how to fill in for me."
    C "So your normal student council work is moping under the statue out in the garden?"
    "There's a moment where Vittoria processes what I'm saying, upon which her expression turns sour."
    H "I gave Vincenza {b}specific{/b} instructions!"
    C "Well, she's not following them. She's just kind of upset about how you kicked her out of the nurse's office."
    H "God knows I would rather be out there with her and not lying in the nurse's office, but {b}someone{/b} has to do our nightly rounds!"
    "I shrug my shoulders casually. Whatever their duties as President and Vice President entail, it's not my concern whatsoever, and I'm not volunteering to help out with them. I came here for a different reason."
    C "Why did you and Vincenza have sex with me together?"
    H "This again? Clover, you {b}literally begged us{/b} to do it. Don't go regretting it now after we tried to warn you."
    C "I didn't say I {b}regret{/b} it, okay?"
    H "So what? Did you come here because you want to go again? You picked the absolute worst day to suddenly show an interest again, Clover."
    "Vittoria takes what I'm asking a completely different direction than what I intended, but it's hard to just come out and tell her that's not what I meant when just the mere suggestion turned her gloomy expression into such a bright, blushing grin."
    H "If Vincenza were here and I weren't stricken lame, we'd definitely—"
    "I cover my eyes to muffle the sounds of whatever shocking things Vittoria says she wants to do to me, but I can still see her lips move and vaguely make out some of the details."
    "When she finally finishes speaking, I release my ears, at which points she tacks on an additional offer for me to consider."
    H "Maybe this time you want to try it on us too. Don't worry, I can teach you exactly how to do it just perfectly, and Vincenza won't mind playing test subject!"
    C "U-Umm, actually, Vittoria, that's not what I was asking..."
    H "Eh?"
    "The thought of maybe going another round with Vittoria and Vincenza does kind of excite me at some level, but my memory of the hollow feeling which came after the lascivious high eclipsed sours the expectations."
    C "I mean, like, why you do it {b}with your sister{/b}. You didn't even entertain the thought of doing \"it\" without Vincenza with you. She said I shouldn't ask you about it, but I never promised her not to."
    "Vittoria quickly turns more beet red to the face than when she was actively detailing how she and Vincenza were going to go about {i}bleep{/i}ing my {i}bleep{/i} and other such lewd acts."
    H "W-We don't— I mean, when we get in the mood, it's better that there's... another girl in the middle, right?"
    "Vittoria stumbles over her word in rapid succession in a way that I've never seen out of her before. It's rewarding to see someone who usually teases me so mercilessly fumbling over herself, even if I have no idea what she's rambling on about."
    "She does eventually collect herself enough to try to reply in a more coherent way which sounds more diplomatic and less emotional than her last."
    H "Listen, Clover, I don't know what Vincenza told you, but she and I are twin sisters, and things which may not seem normal to normal sisters do not feel so strange when we have been so close by one another our whole lives."
    C "So... what you're saying is that it's not that awkward between you when you do it?"
    "With a heavy sigh, Vittoria merely says \"yes\", and repeats it again right after."
    H "Yes. When we make love to another girl at the same time, there's nothing awkward about it at all. If that's all you were wondering about, I'm glad that was cleared up, Clover."
    "I've always thought Vittoria was the maybe slightly less weird of the two, but Vincenza was right that something about it really set her off into the loco zone."
    C "Huh. Okay."
    H "But if things don't work out with Tanya, the offer stills stands for us to..."
    C "Tanya? What about her? Are you and Vincenza doing {b}that stuff{/b} with her too?"

    H "Now that you both {b}have{/b} apologized, however, it is the perfect opportunity to take your friendship to the next level, don't you think?"
    C "Yeah, we are?"
    H "You {b}are{/b}!? She didn't tell us that!"
    C "Yeah. We've more or less stopped fighting and we're going to be working together on drafting plans to re-work the Wild Roses' midfield strategies tomorrow in the library."

    C "(Dang it, Clover, that stuff was supposed to stay buried in your past!)"
    C "...Or something. I read a book about it once."
    mi "Can I borrow Clover next time we try it, Tanya?"
    T "Why are you asking {b}me{/b}? I don't own her."
    T "And I see what you're trying to do here, by the way. I {b}told{/b} you all that it's not like that."
    mi "What {b}I'm{/b} doing? Why, I am helpfully providing a place for two of my students to work on their extra-curriculars at the request of the Student Council!"
    "Nevermind whatever Tanya and Miss Izzie seem to be arguing about, I get right to work unpacking my bag, prompting Tanya to do the same after some feet dragging."
    C "Come here and brainstorm with us, Miss Izzie! I'm sure you have lots of good ideas too!"
    "I'm totally confident in my plans, but it doesn't hurt to have someone with experience on your side, and Miss Izzie is probably the most fanatic supporter of the team out of anyone."
    "She looks like she wants to yank a chair right up the table with us, but with a bite to her lower lip she only tells us that she has other matters to attend to and cannot join in."
    mi "I have a very important staff meeting starting exactly {b}right now{/b}."

    C "Keep it on. I like background music when I'm thinking."
    "Without being able to bring my smartphone with me outside the bedroom, I am unable to play my music while studying. Even when I'm at my desk in my room, I still don't put it on speaker like I used to out of respect for Sibyl."
    C "(Sibyl probably wouldn't appreciate the louder screamo bands I was fond of in middle school. It's probably time that I get into more adult music like jazz.)"
    C "So here, take a lok at this."
    "When Tanya finally reaches her seat opposite mine at the desk, I pull out a pen and flip to a blank page in my notebook to illustrate the plans I've been cultivating in my head."
    C "Before that last game, we've been mostly playing two-way midfield all the way through, right? But in that match, we switched to an offensive and defensive setup which worked well."
    T "Uh huh."
    "As I scribble my thoughts out onto the crude sketch of a lacrosse field, I suddenly realize that what is in my brain isn't all that well visualized by the mad scribbles coming out of my pen."
    C "I think we should keep at it. We keep one offensive midfielder and station here {b}here{/b}, one defensive midfielder stationed here, and we keep one two-way in the middle."
    T "To cover the OM and DM on either side of the field."
    C "Exactly!"
    T "And the DM gets the long stick?"
    C "Of course!"
    "Happily enough, Tanya appears to be following me step for step even with my sub-par drawing skills."
    C "(Is this how Vittoria and Vincenza feel with on another all the time?)"
    T "It's a good plan, Clover. I assume you put yourself into the DM position here?"
    C "Yeah. I was thinking you'd play well in the two-way role."
    T "Even though I'm the best shot taker in our midfield lineup?"
    C "Well, that's true, but... you're also the strongest player we have when it comes to having the stamina to play two-way the full sixty minutes."
    C "Even if you won't be able to get so many shots in, I think the two-way is the most important player on he field since she's covering for the OM and DM on pressure, as well as keeping herself open to intercept passes or advance the ball."
    "Tanya's marble-like brown eyes flicker over the scribbles between us as she pauses to think in silence. After a moment she reaches out to tap my hand, which confuses me until I realize she just wants my pen."
    T "You have us more or less lined up in the midfield. What if we put two OMs up font in parallel with the DM in back, forming a triangle like this?"
    "Dreadful memories of geometry class return to me as Tanya scribbles a triangle over my earlier scribbles, but it's something else entirely that captures my attention."
    C "You smell good."
    T "What?"
    "With Tanya having leaned closer to me over the desk to draw on my notebook, I get a pleasant whiff of something earthy and floral radiating off of her. I have to lean in slightly further just to catch it again."
    T "S-Stop that!"
    C "Lavender and... something. Is that your shampoo?"
    T "Lavender and rosemary! It's my SPF moisturizer."
    T "You should be wearing some too, Clover. It's more important than ever to take care of your skin as we approach Summer and we're spending more time outside."
    C "You're probably right. My neck was that kind of red that goes white when you press on it after the last game."
    T "That's {b}sunburn{/b}, Clover!"
    C "But it din't hurt. It was just kind of red."
    T "You really need to go down to the academy store and buy some sunscreen. It's a miracle your skin has remained so firm and unblemished when you mistreat it as much as you do."
    C "(She's complimenting me! {b}Tanya{/b} is complimenting me.)"
    "I let myself soak into the rare moment of praise from Tanya. Even if it is delivered by way of chastisement, I know that she only means well in wanting me to take care of my skin better."
    C "(There's no way I can tell her that my skin only stayed so fair because I used to carry around that all-black, lace-trimmed parasol around with me.)"
    "Tanya eventually drags me back to the scribbles on the sheet of paper between us and the task at hand."
    C "Oh, yeah, I guess that you could do that, but then there'd be a big gap in the middle of the field and the DM won't have any support."
    T "If you're able to throw accurate, long distance passes like you did during the last game, moving the ball up through the dead zone won't be a problem."
    C "Maybe, but I'm not personally even a starting player, remember? And if most of our midfield is pushed so ar forward, it makes it easier for the other team to pass around the DM and into the defensive zone."
    "It takes another half dozen pages full of wavy scribbles, long arcing arrows, and labelled circles for us to come to an agreement."
    "Despite how much back and forth we do, it actually doesn't take all that long. Izzie returns before long to check on how we're doing, but we're already done."
    mi "Ooh, show me what ya got!"
    "Tanya takes the lead lying out our plan while I try to point to each piece in the most sane set of doodle in my notebook."

    "For just a moment, I think that maybe everything I thought about what Tanya must be feeling could be wrong, but then I remember that Vincenza mused she might be so mean to me precisely because she has those feelings."

    "This new and bashful Tanya is all so irresistibly..."

    C "You used to be the bane of my existence, or so I thought, but somehow I've come to realize that most everything I can do now is because you helped me to it along the way."

    C "I may not know exactly how or why or when I started feeling this way, but I know that there's a reason you're showing up in my dreams, and that's because I \"like\ you."
    "It's a surprise even to me how many words come out once I start talking and how intelligible they are — maybe even exactly the words I need to say."
    "Tanya watches and listens silently from across the table the whole time, neither judgemental nor sympathetic, just soberly attentive. It makes it that much easier to keep going."
    T "That was really sweet, Clover, and I can tell you thought about it a lot."
    C "I {b}do{/b} have a brain despite what you keep implying, and I'll use it for things that are important. Right now, what I am feeling for you is what's important, and I want to know if you feel the same way."
    "Though I don't say it, part of what is making me so serious now is how badly I flubbed my first crush on Sibyl. I learned my lessons then so that I won't make the same mistakes now."
    C "(I'm so sorry, Sibyl, but all the messiness you had to deal with then is going to make things come out better this time for sure.)"
    T "I don't think that I, nor anyone else, could ever remain unmoved when a girl as pretty as you are says such sweet things to her."
    C "Yeah, Vittoria and Vincenza {b}told{/b} me that you like blondes, but I want to know if you actually \"like\" me, Tanya! You wouldn't have tried to kiss me if you didn't, would you?"
    "The terrible thought that maybe I was wrong and that Tanya only wanted to kiss me because she likes my hair absolutely terrifies me."
    T "I like you, Clover, and not just because of your looks. You really, {b}really{/b} pissed me off when you first got here, you know?"
    C "(Yes, {b}I know{/b}. I still haven't forgotten about those deaths threats.)"
    T "But you've changed so much since I first met you. It happened to slowly that I almost didn't see it happen myself."
    T "There's a lot of dedicated girls on the Wild Roses roster, but none of them can match me the same as you can, and even though we may fight sometimes, I know it will only to make us stronger together."
    C "I-I feel the same way!"
    "It may have started with trying to beat Tanya at her own game as a way of putting her down, but now we're genuinely pushing each other to be a little bit better each and every day."
    T "You're a really cool girl now, Clover, and I want to \"like\" you the same way you think you \"like\" me."
    C "What do you mean you {b}want{/b} to \"like\" me? You tried to {b}kiss{/b} me, didn't you!?"
    "After feeling so light inside hearing Tanya say all those nice things about me, to suddenly hear her clarify that she might only like me and not \"like\" like me feels like a bucket of cold water dumped over my head."
    "I'm nearly jumping out of my seat again, and though I don't raise my voice too loudly, Tanya still does motion for me to calm myself before she continues."
    T "Listen, Clover, you don't really know anything {b}about{/b} me."
    C "I know that—!"
    T "That I like lacrosse? That I'm Chinese?"
    "I want to object to Tanya's reasoning, but I am forced to admit that she's totally correct. Everything that Tanya says sounds reasonable enough to me, though I most certainly do not wish to believe it."
    C "(If we both \"like\" each other, or \"want to like\" at least, then what's the problem?)"
    "There was no doubt in my mind that if we both feel the same way about each other, there'd be nothing at all to stand in the way of whatever comes next."
    C "I-Is this about... Sibyl?"
    T "What about her? I thought you were over her."
    "Tanya's face screws up like I'm asking the stupidest question in the world, with just a little grimace which is no doubt because she thinks I might be trying to have them {b}both{/b}."
    C "I'm over her! Waaay over! I meant, umm, about you and her."
    T "Clover, you moron, how many times do I have to say it? I was never really serious about pursuing her in the first place."
    T "Sibyl is straight. I knew that from the beginning and never once had any expectation of changing that, unlike {b}you{/b}."
    T "She's my BFF and I'll do anything for her, but anything romantic that I ever wanted to exist between me and her was over before it ever started."
    C "Okay, good. Sorry, I just had to be sure."
    "All of the impatience which had suddenly flared in Tanya is gone in the next moment, her face returning to an expression more familiar to see upon it."

    "How quickly I am able to recall the names of the character is a welcome surprise, and proof enough that I do in fact have a capable brain after all."
    C "A friend I had in middle school practically begged me to read the first volume, but I never kept up with it after that."
    T "Oh."

    C "I-Is that a \"bay hee mon wah\"?"
    T "No, not at all, but also, maybe a little similar."
    C "(Ummmm, okay?)"
    T "That one is Japanese, so it's a manga. When it's Chinese, it's a manhua."

    C "Okay, I get it! Not porn!"
    C "(What makes this embarrassing exactly? Was it all really ugly amateur art?)"
    C "So you used to draw this stuff? Were you ever published?"
    T "Most manhua doesn't get sold as a physical book like manga, but I did self-publish online where I received a lot of likes and comments."
    C "What so embarrassing about this then? it sound to me like you're just bragging about your art skills and how popular you are! I feel ripped off!"
    T "Is it {b}so{/b} totally embarrassing, Clover! Art is an extension of your inner self, so publishing these works is like suddenly exposing the parts of you that no one sees to millions of people."
    C "I thought you said it {b}wasn't{/b} porn!"
    T "Clover, I am {b}seriously{/b} going to strangle you to death right now."
    C "Nooo!"
    "I inch away from Tanya on the tree branch, but not fast enough as she easily captures my arm to carefully slide me right back beside her."
    C "I promise I won't tell anyone else about your porn books, so don't kill me pleaase!"
    T "I know it might be hard, but would you {b}try{/b} to use your brain for a moment, Clover?"
    T "There are a lot of my thoughts and feelings... my passions and desires... expressed in my manhua."
    T "That I'm willing to show them to you... don't you {b}understand{/b} what that means?"
    "The dark marbles of tanya's eyes silently bore through me as she awaits my response, showing both indignation at my indifference but also pleading for me to reassure her that it wasn't a mistake to reveal this to me."
    C "(She hasn't even told Sibyl about this? So I know something about Tanya that even {b}Sibyl{/b} doesn't know!?)"
    "The answer comes to me, but I replay it over in my head a few times before I speak it aloud, just to make sure it sounds as smart and well-reasoned as Tanya is expecting."
    C "Just like I revealed my super shameful goth past that I don't want anyone to know about or even ever think about for the rest of my life, you're willing to share with me equally personal \"manhua\" that shows the sides of you that no one else sees."
    "My answer is evidently satisfactory to Tanya judging by the little sigh of relief she gives, though she does not release the grip on my arm quite yet."
    T "Thank you for understanding, Clover."
    C "You {b}did{/b} say that you wanted to actually know the real me, so it only makes sense that you want me to know the real you too."
    T "Exactly. That's my whole goal for our date today."
    C "Is it normal to make goals for dates?"
    T "U-Umm—..."
    "My question unexpectedly throws Tanya for a loop. She stammers, then pauses, releasing my arm finally, to express herself more eloquently than she started."
    T "As long as we're being honest, you're the first person who has wanted to date me and who I felt I wanted to try to make it work with."
    T "Am I overthinking this too much?"
    C "Maybe a little, but I don't think you're wrong to want to take it slowly and carefully."
    C "I rushed too fast into my feelings for Sibyl and ended up hurting us both, so maybe setting a simple goal for our date isn't such a bad thing at all?"
    T "Did you have a goal for our date?"
    "My blood pressure spikes such that my heart is pounding in my ears, or maybe it's because all the blood has drained out of my lower extremities and into my head."
    C "(Of course I set a goal!)"
    "After hearing all about Tanya's forthright plans to evaluate her and my feelings for one another, it's kind of hard to tell her what my goal was."
    "At the same time, not telling her and pretending I didn't have a goal at all would be dishonest and totally against the entire rationale of her goal, so I try to push down the anxiety creeping up my chest to be qui honest with Tanya."
    C "C-Can I... kiss you?"
    T "Clover..."
    C "Y-Yeah...?"
    "Tanya speaks my name so softly, drawing me in. I inch just a little closer, nearly rubbing my side against hers as I gaze into her eyes, so happy she didn't shut me down."
    T "You don't {b}ask{/b} for a kiss!"
    C "H-wha!?"
    T "You just {b}do it{/b} when the mood is good! {b}Idiot{/b}!"
    C "S-Shut up, Tanya!"
    T "Make me!"
    C "I {b}will{/b}!"
    "Like a foolhardy bather into a lake of piranhas, I grab Tanya by the arm and close the gap between us without any hesitation."
    "I brace myself for an awkward meeting of our faces, but rather than bump noses or bash foreheads, our lips come together smoothly almost like Tanya was expecting it."
    C "(There's no way... She was yelling at me just a fraction of a second ago!)"
    "The kiss is {b}sublime{/b}, like the kiss I shared with Sibyl but at least three and a half times better. Not only am I obviously way into it, but this time the girl whose lips I'm squishing with mine own is very into it too."
    C "(Mission: accomplished.)"
    "We both pull back in an entirely natural conclusion of the simple kiss, but the distance between us remains small."
    "The world outside the gap of air between us might as well not exist. Smoldering glances flicker between our half-lidded eyes while little creeping touches tease against one another."
    "The atmosphere is so charged between us that our lips draw together magnetically once again in another instant."
    C "Hnf."
    T "Mmn."
    "Our first was clean. Pure. The second is less so."
    "There's a desire plainly in both of us, and though we do not quite get French about it, we're well on our way as neither wants to pull away even as we sink deeper into the kiss."
    "{i}Tanya and Clover, sittin' in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-{/i}"
    "Tanya and I both separate the instant we hear our names called from back by the campus buildings all the way across the field, followed by some ensuing commotion and many giggles."
    C "(Were we always this close?)"
    "My first surprise, before evening looking the direction of the sounds, is just how much the two of us had come together physically while we were kissing."
    "Our knees are pressed together, our legs practically entwined, and what little grip we weren't using to stay securely in the tree found their way to pawing at each other."
    "Naturally, this is the first thing to go when we're suddenly exposed, both jumping apart like we got caught with our hands in the cookie jar."
    T "I can't {b}believe{/b} they found me!"
    "When I do follow Tanya's eyes, I peer through the small clearing in the foliage that allows us to look back at the campus, to find a whole gaggle of bodies hiding around the corner of the chapel looking right back at us through the same gap."
    C "(Tanya's right. Those people would have to have been looking for us to notice us through such a small gap on the other side of the field.)"
    "I have to squint a little bit to make them out, but I can clearly make out Miss Woolsey lifting the much smaller Miss Izzie, who appears to be flailing in protest, and carry her back behind the wall of the chapel."
    "There's a tall blonde woman I've never seen there too, as well as at least half a dozen or more other pink shapes that I recognize as our uniform."
    "I do manage to identify Vittoria and Vincenza before they and the rest of the students spying on us realize we have noticed them and also make their escape behind the chapel wall."
    T "Let's go, Clover."
    C "But we just got here!"
    "Even as I say it, I notice while looking back at the chapel again how much more aggressively angled the shadows have gotten since we first arrived."
    "The trip back down the tree turns out to be even harder than the journey up it, but I manage to return to Mother Earth in one piece with sufficient time and effort. Tanya hops down behind me like it's nothing."
    C "(Show off!)"

    C "Sibyl, I'm back!"
    C "Tanya's here too. She says she wants to get to the cafeteria right when it opens tonight."
    "Like the superb student she is, Sibyl is hard at work on her homework for next week when we enter the room. At our arrival she turns in her desk chair to lean over the back and greet us."
    S "Welcome back! How did the date..."
    "Sibyl's question trails out quietly as she glances between us, but she finishes again soon enough with an eerie grin and lilt ot her voice after another moment longer."
    S "...go?"
    "I glance at Tanya just as she does the same to me in a move similar to the twins, confirming that both of us think Sibyl is acting weird."
    C "It was nice. I learned a lot about Tanya that I did not know before."
    T "There is perhaps more to Clover than I realized, and I have to complement the way you did her makeup, Sibyl. She looks {b}amazing{/b}."
    S "There's no need to be modest, Tanya! You two could barely keep away from each other, huh?"
    "Again, Sibyl breaks out into giggles, which are eerily reminiscent of the girls who also giggled at us as we passed them at the entrance to the dormitory."
    S "I would be happy to offer some of my makeup if you are interested, Tanya."
    T "Umm... No, thanks. I don't think it would really suit my image at all."
    S "Are you sure? I think my lip gloss looks good on you!"
    C "But you didn't put any on Tanya?"
    "I expect Tanya to back upon this, but instead she sprints off into the adjoining backroom and shrinks back from the mirror in horror."

    "Two swipes of Sibyl's makeup remover to clean up the disaster around both of our mouths and many professions of never letting anyone see our faces ever again later, the three of us finally set off for the cafeteria."
