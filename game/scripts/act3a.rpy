    "The excitement of homecoming swiftly fades into the doldrums of passing the week-long Easter break when most students have left for home."
    S "Tanya! Gimme your threes!"
    T "Go fish."
    S "Aww..."
    "Sibyl surprised me on Sunday by attending services in the academy's chapel."
    "She told me after that she isn't religious, but that the foster family she has been with for the past few years used to take her and her foster sibling every Christmas and Easter."
    C "(She probably just went because there's nothing {b}else{/b} to do with everyone else away.)"
    "All student activities are on hold, both classes and extra-curriculars. Even the cafeteria is operating with a depressingly limited menu."
    "Sibyl and Tanya both also have chosen to stay behind, leaving the three of us to scrape the bottom of the barrel of activities to entertain us."
    T "I'll take your tens, Sibyl."
    S "Here you go!"
    "I've always gotten the impression that Sibyl genuinely likes her foster family, so why she hasn't chosen to return home is a bit of a mystery to me."
    "As the game drags on well into the afternoon, I try to think up ways I can subtly ask her about it in a manner that won't sound like I'm prying into her personal business."
    S "Clover, it's your turn."
    C "Huh? Oh, umm, Sibyl, have any nines?"
    S "Tanya {b}just{/b} took them from me. Are you feeling alright, Clover?"
    "Realizing that I must be zoning out further than I think I am, I confess to being bored with Go Fish and propose just ending the game altogether."
    "The other two accept so quickly that I almost feel like they must have been thinking of ending the game too. All three of us flop down on the bed with exaggerated malaise."
    T "I'm so glad you're staying for Easter break, Sibyl. Are you sure your foster family won't mind?"
    "After thinking how best to ask such a personal question to Sibyl, Tanya suddenly outright asks the very same thing I was wondering."
    S "It's only a week, and after seeing how stir-crazy you were after our Christmas break I couldn't do that to you again."
    "It's clear from Tanya's expression that she doesn't like this answer, and Sibyl is quick to alleviate her concerns posthaste."
    S "Really, I wanted to stay! The whole reason I applied for this scholarship is to experience all the ups and downs of living out on my own."
    T "Okay, but why is Clover still here? I thought she was finally getting along with her parents again?"
    "That Tanya asks Sibyl instead of me gets on my nerves, so despite how I don't really care to share my personal life with her, now I feel obligated."
    C "I also {b}chose{/b} to stay here this week, Tanya."
    "I've told Sibyl all about what happened with my parents' divorce, but given Tanya's dated knowledge of my situation I assume that my roommate hasn't been talking behind my back."
    "Tanya must have realized {b}something{/b} was wrong when I suddenly fell apart right before the tryouts, but she usually has enough tact not to shove her face where it doesn't belong."
    C "For your information, my parents' divorce was finalized a few weeks ago. I've accepted that it happened but that doesn't mean I'm prepared to go back to whatever will be \"home\" from now on."
    T "That sounds like you're avoiding your parents to me."
    C "Well I didn't {b}ask{/b} your opinion, did I? Why are {b}you{/b} still here?"
    T "Did you really expect me to fly all the way to Singapore and back again over a one week break?"
    C "Singa-{b}what{/b}? I thought you were Chinese?"
    T "I {b}am{/b} Chinese, but my parents and siblings all live in Singapore."
    T "We used to go back and forth living between here and there when I was little. Ever since my older brother's wife had their baby, however, everyone else in my family has remained there."
    C "Why?"
    T "Look, Clover, family as a concept is entirely different in Asia than it is here. It's better for everyone that I stay in America."
    "It's obvious that the topic is more than a little touchy for Tanya so i drop it altogether. There's no sense in aggravating Tanya, especially when Sibyl is around to tell us off."

    "After lunch we head to the library as our next means of passing the time away."
    "Sibyl gets lost in her {i}Girls' Mix{/i} back issues while I opt to flip casually through an {i}Archaeology Insights{/i} article issue about the Sumerian priestess Enheduanna."
    C "(She really liked this \"Inanna\" person, huh?)"
    "A flutter in my peripheral vision from across the table draws my attention away. It's Tanya holding her {i}Sports Annotated{/i} issue open longways from top to bottom."
    C "What are you doing to that magazine?"
    T "Nothing!"
    "Tanya quickly stammers and turns it the right way to flip to the next page, which only makes her actions all the more suspicious."
    C "Gimme that."
    T "Hey!"
    "I snatch the magazine from her hands. The cover features some woman in a bathing suit at the beach."
    C "(Maybe there's an article about surfing?)"
    "I flip through all the pages to find whatever might cause Tanya to hold it so awkwardly, and find the center pages of the magazine fit the orientation."
    C "Hmm..."
    "I first cant my head sideways, then turn the hole magazine around like Tanya did before."
    C "(I wonder if she likes blondes?)"
    "It's no surfing article but a head to toe photograph of a blonde-haired model in a bikini that made Tanya flip the whole magazine around."
    C "(No, I don't think this is surfing related at all. Or any sport for that matter.)"
    "The model is pretty, sure, but way too made up for the photoshoot in my opinion."
    S "What's up? Is there a good article in that issue?"
    C "Uh, just some new lacrosse stick models. You probably wouldn't be interested, Sibyl."
    "I quickly toss the magazine back at Tanya and earn a quiet glare, though she predictably catches it before impact."
    C "Speaking of lacrosse, when are the practices starting up again?"
    T "The first Tuesday after everyone returns from Easter break."
    S "I'm so glad that you're going to continue playing lacrosse, Clover. I just {b}know{/b} you're going to do great!"
    C "That's the plan! I can't let Tanya hog all the glory in the midfield."
    T "Maybe if you didn't gorge yourself on French toast every morning you could keep up!"
    C "I {b}told{/b} you that I need that sugar energy!"
    T "You really don't."
    C "Maybe {b}you{/b} don't!"
    S "Let's go find a book about sports nutrition, Clover! There's sure to be one around here somewhere."
    "I know that Sibyl is only trying to cut off a bigger conflict between me and Tanya before it starts but I don't hesitate to take her up on the offer."
    "Unfortunately, when we do find the book and pore through the impressively dense text, Tanya doesn't hesitate to gloat about her being right in the end."
    "Tanya thinks she has all the answers about keeping up with her athletics, and admittedly, the results are impressive. That leaves me with only one choice."

    T "What are you {b}doing{/b} here, Clover?"
    "Against my better judgement, I manage to drag myself out of the sweet caress of sleep early the next morning to ambush Tanya before she goes out on her daily run."
    C "Training. Since you have {b}all{/b} the answers, I'm gong to do everything you do."
    T "What? No, not gonna happen."
    C "Are you afraid that I'm going to get better than you?"
    T "{b}No{/b}, that's not going to happen. I just don't want you bothering me while I'm in the zone."
    C "Then you'd better start taking laps in your room if you don't want me around. Besides, won't the {b}team{/b} play better if {b}I{/b} play better?"
    "I make a big show of warming up to run, which coupled with my flawless arguments immediately changes Tanya's tine without any more need for discussion."
    T "Fine. It's a big field and there's plenty of room for both of us. Besides, you won't be able to keep up with me anyway."
    C "Oh yeah? We'll see about that!"
    "When Tanya starts off, I kick it into high gear to keep up to pace with her. Though she has no music in her ears or anything, she remains focused straight ahead without ever getting distracted."
    C "(Is she counting steps in her head? How does she stay so {b}focused{/b}?)"
    "I fight on valiantly, but by the time I'm huffing and puffing with each step, Tanya's still as cool and composed as when she started."
    "Tanya cleanly finishes her desired number of laps and proceeds off the field to walk a small loop in place as she checks her pulse."
    C "(Seriously, what is {b}with{/b} her!?)"
    "I make well sure to finish the exact same amount of circuits as Tanya did, just so she can't hold that over my head too."
    "With the last circuit finished, I stagger on shaky legs over to where Tanya rests and flop unceremoniously on my back into the cool grass."
    T "Your warm up was adequate but you need to {b}cool down{/b} after running too. If you don't, your muscles will tighten up and become sore."
    C "Shut up, Tanya!"
    "Despite my nearly-breathless exclamation at Tanya, I manage to scrape myself off the ground and walk a few circles around my running partner before flopping back into the grass."
    T "Here, hydrate."
    C "{b}Urk!{/b}"
    "Tanya responds to my jibe by dropping my water bottle right on top of my stomach, resulting in the rather unpleasant sounding exclamation as it impacts, but no lasting damage."

    S "I'm so proud of you, Clover!"
    "Sibyl's praise is even sweeter than the maple syrup-drizzled yogurt parfait that I struggle to shovel into my mouth with the last of my remaining energy."
    T "Today was the fastest time ever."
    S "That's great! Just last week you were telling me that you thought your times were stuck in a rut."
    "Neither of us want to admit it for our own selfish reasons, but we both know the only reason Tanya was able to break her record is because I was there to challenge her."
    "After lunch, I fall into a deep food coma and nap so long that I almost miss lunch time were it not for a timely intervention by Sibyl and Tanya."

    "I bravely flop out of bed at the crack of dawn the next morning too. Tanya is already waiting for me at the lacrosse field when I arrive."
    T "Good, you're here. I was beginning to think I broke you after pushing too hard yesterday. Warm up and grab a stick."
    "Some manner of grumbling quivers my vocal cords but produces only an unintelligible retort to Tanya's upbeat denigration."
    "The cool morning air and the reinvigorated coursing of blood through my body as a result of my warm-ups eventually returns proper English words to my speech."
    C "What are the lacrosse sticks for? Aren't we going to run laps again?"
    T "I wanted to try something a little more tough now that I have a partner. Think you can keep up with me?"
    C "Quit looking down on me, Tanya. You're no better at anything than I am; you just have a head start on training!"
    "Rather than do simple laps around the field, we both grab a stick and run in parallel up and down the length of the field, tossing and catching the ball to one another as we go."
    C "(I'm not going to let Tanya brag off to Sibyl today! This is the day that I hold my own until {b}Tanya{/b} is the one sobbing into her granola!)"
    "My desired victory ultimately fails to come to fruition, but despite the workout being doubly as intense as the day before, I manage to hold my own all the way until we call it quits."
    C "(This counts as a victory for me, right?)"
    "The twins are waiting on the sidelines to ambush us when we finally finish our jog and pass laps. As we greedily gulp down the contents of our water bottles, the President and Vice President silently circle us in opposite directions."
    "With Tanya clearly just ignoring them, I am forced the be the one who has to speak up to this strange behavior."
    C "Umm... What's happening here?"
    O "We are observing the competition."
    C "Competition?"
    T "Honestly, Clover. If you don't want to play their games, just ignore them."
    "Having been first to strike out at whatever game the twins might be playing, they take the opportunity to pounce around either side of her."
    "Vincenza stops right in front to tug softly at her necktie like something might happen if she does, while her sister Vittoria slides around back to daintily lift the back of her skort - only to realize with a pout that it is indeed a skort."
    T "What are you even doing here? Shoo, shoo."
    "As before, all it takes for Tanya to remove the twins' unwanted incursion is for her to tell them off, though she does reserve a soft flick to the forehead for Vittoria, who probably deserves it."
    O "The Easter break is almost over."
    H "Our flight was moved up at the last moment."
    "I've noticed it too — how many more girls are populating the cafeteria in the past day."

    C "Y-Yeah, Tanya is the worst. I hate her."
    "I end up throwing what Tanya said about me back at the twins, but really it's more directed at Tanya who started it in the first place."

    "Tanya whips the equipment bag over her shoulder and storms off without another word, or even waiting for me to follow her back to return the crosse still in my hands."
    C "What was all that about?"
    O "We may have teased her a little too strongly."
    H "Tanya has something of a \"love-hate relationship\" with blondes."

    C "Let me first make one thing clear; I'm {b}not{/b} worried about Tanya."
    C "What does she have against blondes anyway?"
    O "Has she ever told you about her Vertu partner, Sierra?"
    C "Her Vertu? The girl who is apparently the human incarnation of everything bad in the world according to Tanya?"
    O "Yes, {b}that{/b} Sierra."
    "It is true that Sierra has blonde hair similar to mine, except that my large sample of secondhand knowledge about her indicates that she's way worse of a person than me even on my worst days."
    H "I believe the phrase Tanya used was \"hate-fuck\"."
    C "Like, she hates her, but wants to... you know?"
    H "Well, Sierra {b}is{/b} gorgeous, right?"

    C "(It almost seems like they're implying they'd sleep with anyone who is super pretty, but that can't be true because they slept me someone like me.)"
    "A shiver unrelated to the cool early Spring air washes over me, and I try to push what happened that day completely out of my mind again."
    C "Well I'm {b}not{/b} Sierra, so if that's what's behind the {b}problem{/b} Tanya has with me, she can leave the attitude back in her dorm room."
    H "Maybe that enough gossipping for today. We did not come here {b}just{/b} to tease you both."

    "The twins before me are very obviously not satisfied with my answer given the way they look toward one another, so in the interest of getting them off my back I throw them a few scraps to nibble on."
    C "I'm not very good with being in the spotlight so Sibyl kinda coerced me and Tanya to go to the dance together and use the homecoming competition as a way for me to face those fears."
    "Rather than express any interest whatsoever in what is an admission of a deeply held fear of mine, Vittoria and Vincenza are somehow more interested in Sibyl's role in the whole affair."
    O "So it was not Tanya who asked you to the dance..."
    H "...But rather our pigtailed mutual friend who orchestrated the whole thing?"
    C "Yeah, that's what I'm saying."

    T "Did Sibyl's hair get tangled in her sleep again?"
    C "What?"
    T "The last time Sibyl missed breakfast it was because her hair was a disaster zone that she was struggling to rebuild."

    "It doesn't at all come as a surprise to find out that Tanya is worrying about Sibyl in the same way I am, but I really wish she didn't have to flaunt how muh more she knows about my Vertu than I do."

    "I try not to look like I'm worried about what happened to Sibyl, and so too does Tanya despite both of us stealthily glancing toward the doorway every so often."
    "When Sibyl finally does show, it's with two girls on either side of her who aren't {b}us{/b} for once."
    "Vittoria and Vincenza flank her on either side, each linking an arm into hers from each flank. Sibyl apparently thinkings it is the most amusing thing ever by how brightly she's smiling."
    "The trio parts gaily at the entryway, the twins splitting off toward the kitchens together and Sibyl stepping toward our usual table in the cafeteria."
    "The pair of me and Tanya glaring her direction must be a sight to behold because her cheerful smile breaks into a surprised start when she spots us shooting daggers between her and the twins from across the room."

    "Both of us can scarcely conceal our suspicions behind a neutral tone, but that doesn't stop Sibyl from remaining as cheerful as before."
    S "Book recommendations!"
    "It's not just me and Tanya behaving shifty. Sibyl's answer, despite being delivered in a fast and upbeat fashion, is accompanied by a roll of her away away from either of us."
    C "What did you recommend?"
    S "Anne of Green Gables, of course!"
    T "The library has only one copy, and you recommended it to both of them?"
    S "They do everything else together, so why not read together?"
    "Even with both of us trying to subtly interrogate her, Sibyl gives up nothing at all and quickly switches gears toward our plans for the rest of the day."
    C "What makes it a \"break\" if the teachers assign homework over it?"
    S "No whining, Clover! You have to keep your grades up if you want to stay on the lacrosse team."

    "Like a beast tearing into captured prey, I rip a corner off my science worksheet, chew up the little strip of paper, and swallow it whole."
    C "It's just a little paper. It's not going to kill me."
    "Tanya scoffs at my display of indifference to her dare. She could have asked much worse, I know, and I got off easy when she didn't even dare me to eat the whole thing."
    "The pencil turns around once more, landing this time on Sibyl who claps her hands together before her in delight."

    T "What? {b}Why{/b}? I've already told you some of it before, haven't I?"

    C "What's up with Tanya's family? Is she hiding something about them?"
    T "Nothing is \"up\" with them. They're all happily living together in Singapore!"
    S "Yes, but... don't you think Clover would be able to understand you better if she knew about the conflicts you've had in your family life?"
    S "Clover has also had struggles in her relationship to her family, and that's one thing I just can't help her with myself. I think the two of you could help each other."
    "The reasoning for the dare is laid bare, as is probably the entire purpose of playing this game in the first place."
    T "Fine, but only because you ordered me to do it and I want to boss you around too."
    "Gritting her teeth for moment as she no doubt tries to formulate where to start, Tanya chooses to stare down Sibyl rather than look at me while re-telling her tale of family troubles."
    T "Where I come from, family is everything, and everything we do as individuals reflects on the whole family."
    C "Okay, and...?"
    T "When we picked up and moved to Singapore from America, I found I could no longer pursue certain interests of mine publicly. They were \"embarrassing\" the family, and so my parents asked me to stop."
    T "Except there are some things I can't just \"stop\" being, so eventually they sent their embarrassment of a daughter back to America half a world away."
    "She's clearly glossing over something important, but what strikes me is the similarity to my own troubles. Just like I felt like I was abandoned here, so too must Tanya feel like she's abandoned half a world away."
    C "What did they ask you not to do?"
    "Tanya send me a chilling glare when I dig for more information out of her, but it's toward SIbyl that her gaze edges when she goes to answer."
    T "That's personal and totally outside the scope of the dare."
    C "Fine, but why did your family evn move away if they were just going to send you back here anyway?"

    C "(So her parents picked up and moved their whole lives for her brother but dumped Tanya here? How is that fair?)"
    "It's clear from the dark expression on Tanya's face that she doesn't think it's fair at all, and I can't blame her one bit."
    S "Thank you for sharing, Tanya."
    "Tanya grumbles a bit dismissively, as eager to move on as anyone asked to divulge personal history, and spins the pencil herself. The point edges her direction, bringing a small smile back to her face."
    T "Truth or Dare."
    S "Truth."
    "It takes a couple minutes, but eventually Tanya does come out with a question, and a juicy one at that."
    T "Sibyl, did you really, umm..."
    S "What is it?"
    T "...{b}Kiss{/b} Clover?"
    "The air between the three of us goes quite still as no sound but the ticking of Sibyl's clock can be heard. The question is clearly a surprise to her, obviously because that Tanya knows means that it was {b}me{/b} who must have told her."
    "That she quickly turns her head my way upon being asked only confirms it."
    S "Y-Yes, it is true. I kissed Clover."
    T "{b}Why!?{/b}"
    S "I'm sorry, that's something you should ask Clover."
    "As eager to move on from the awkward question as Tanya had been earlier, Sibyl sets the pencil spinning at a fast clip which slows upon herself."
    S "What'll it be, Clover? Truth or Dare?"
    "My stomach sinks immediately. Dread floods in to fill the space it left. I know now that this whole game is a ploy to get me and Tanya to open up to one another about our seemingly similar troubles."
    C "(Based on what she dared of Tanya, I'm probably screwed either way I let this play out.)"
    C "Dare."
    S "I dare you to tell us all about your recent issues with your parents and how they made you feel."
    "The \"dare\" is exactly what I was expecting it to be, which isn't really all that bad because I suspect that Tanya has already gleaned much of it already after months of close-ish proximity."
    C "My parents started fighting a year ago, or maybe more now actually. They've always had their problems before, but this time it just wouldn't go away."
    S "Do you know what trouble started the most recent fighting between them?"
    C "N-No, actually... I never asked..."
    C "(Should I have asked? Would I have been able to fix things before it collapsed this totally?)"
    "I've honestly never thought about it before, but as I do now, I'm all but certain neither my mother nor my father would ever have shared a thing with me."
    C "My parents might have had their issues with one another, but to me I was nothing but their most important only child. It was probably {b}me{/b} that kept them together so long..."
    C "Their most recent fight, before I came here to the academy, was the worst I've ever seen. They tried to hide it around me, but I still knew what was happening."
    C "Eventually it got so bad that they took me out of my old school one day and told me I was coming here instead. At the time I thought it was some kind of punishment or a total abandonment, but now I know they only did it out of love."
    T "Your parents abandoned you... out of love!?"
    "Tanya clearly doesn't understand what I'm talking about, and admittedly maybe it doesn't make as much sense when I say what I feel aloud as when I feel what I do inside."
    C "My parents knew that they were causing me strife with their fighting, and with some other personal struggles I was facing, they thought it was better for me to come here for a time instead."
    C "I'm still not completely over their divorce yet, but I like being here and getting to meet the people I have and experience what I have here has changed me for the better."
    C "If my parents hadn't sent me here, I'd probably be struggling even worse back home. They were right to do it, however betrayed I felt at the time."
    "No questions emerge after I finish speaking. I look up toward Sibyl, who made me say what I did, but she's only looking toward Tanya."
    "Tanya, meanwhile, is busy staring intently at the ground in front of her with a far away look in her eyes."
    C "(What... is happening?)"
    "Not wanting to be the first to slice words into the strangely tense atmosphere, I merely stay quite still until Sibyl does the work for me, quietly speaking up to Tanya."
    S "It's your turn again, Tanya. Truth or Dare."
    "Looking back up, and finding the pencil now pointing toward Sibyl, she sighs heavy and answer dispassionately, \"Truth\"."
    S "Tanya, I want you to tell us truthfully what you feel about Clover."
    C "(She just won't let up on me and Tanya, will she? What does she get out of forcing us to get along.)"
    "\"Other than having her two best friends stop bickering with one another every day\", I add in my mind as the obvious answer."
    T "I feel that Clover is a beautiful idiot with an irritating personality and decent lacrosse skills."
    "The way Tanya replies so instantly and matter-of-factly throws me off guard. Her feelings are very contradictory and I'm not sure whether I should thank her or insult her back, so merely stay awkwardly silent."
    C "A-Anyway, let's spin for you now, Sibyl."
    "I try to brush of the uncomfortable atmosphere surrounding us by keeping the game going and planning what I'm going to ask of Sibyl in my head, but unfortunately the pencil lands on Tanya instead of me."
    S "Dare!"
    T "Sibyl, I dare you to kiss me exactly like you kissed Clover before!"
    S "Okay, get ready!"
    C "H-Huh? Wait, you can't!"
    "Before either me or Tanya can prepare, Sibyl darts forward to plant a little peck against Tanya's cheek in a manner conservative even for a family member."
    T "That's not what I meant! I wanted a kiss like however you did it to Clover!"
    "With the same cheeky grin as before, Sibyl declines to give Tanya back her turn and gets away with another light dare as a result."
    "She sets the pencil spinning for my turn, which comes to a halt pointing at Tanya."
    C "It's really time that I get back to my homework."
    T "You can't just quit on your turn! That has to be against the rules!"
    S "Yeah, you have to say it when it's not your turn or else it's clearly an evasion tactic."
    "I know what Tanya would have found a way to ask of me, but I'm obviously now trying to evade whatever horrors might be spawned out of Tanya's brain."
    C "If I honesty tell Tanya what I think of her, can we end the game now?"
    S "Compromise accepted!"
    T "I didn't agree to this!"
    S "Two against one. The odds have shifted in Clover's favor. Now cough it up, Clover!"
    C "Fine, it's nothing crazy anyway. I think Tanya is a really good lacrosse player — though I'm going to be better than her eventually — who can sometimes be annoyingly clever."
    T "That's just a jumble of insults covered by compliments!"
    C "You did the same thing when Sibyl dares you to say how you feel about me!"
    T "What I said was honestly how I feel though!"
    C "Well what {b}I{/b} said is true too!"
    "Even on something so pointless, Tanya and I immediately rush right into a standoff."
    C "(I know that Sibyl wants us to get along, but surely she sees how pointless this is?)"
    T "Whatever, I'm leaving. Sibyl can help you finish the rest of your homework."
    C "I was only telling her what I thought about her, honestly!"
    "I try to explain myself to the lightly pouting Sibyl across the way, but she only remains pensive about the whole blow-up."

    "Tanya gives a short huff, fluffs her fingers through her bangs, and resumes staring at the point in which the lockers meet the floor in front of her. It's like whatever she's trying to say is teh most difficult thing in the world."
    T "Sibyl can be kind of a ditz sometimes, but she can also be a tricky schemer when she wants to be."

    T "What I'm trying to tell you is that you were {b}right{/b}."
    C "Of course I was right, but about what?"
    T "God, do you {b}ever{/b} quit it?"
    T "I mean about why I was sent back to America when the rest of my family all moved to Singapore with my older brother."
    T "It's not because I was an embarrassment that had to be excised from the family, but because I can genuinely live the life I want here when I couldn't over there."
    "Now relatively confident that Tanya isn't going to break my skull open with a crosse, I take a seat on the bench running through the aisle of lockers."
    C "What were you even doing after moving back to China that started this in the first place? You were being awfully coy about that during the game."
    T "I suspect she knows already, but... I still haven't told Sibyl that I'm gay, or that I had a huge crush on her."

    C "Is it, like, {b}illegal{/b} to be gay in China or something?"
    T "Well, no, but it can be, umm... stigmatized. It doesn't help that I was a cringey middle-schooler self-publishing cringey lesbian manhua either, but that was the only way I knew how to express myself."
    C "What's a \"manhua\"?"
    "Tanya finally looks up at me, blinking with a dumfounded expression on her face like I asked the most stupid question in the world."
    "I fully expect to be told some analogy relating how incredibly stupid I am for not knowing something so obvious, but instead she actually just tells me for once."
    T "Do you know what manga is?"
    "I nod my understanding to the question, and to my credit start to put the pieces together before she finally concludes the thought."
    T "It's like that, but Chinese. I was only self-publishing on the internet, but even then everything had to be censored."
    C "You were drawing porn? I mean, I kinda get why it was embarrassing then."
    "My reply is entirely sympathetic to Tanya's plight, having done enough cringey stuff back in middle school to make me want to jump off the nearest cliff right now."
    T "It was {b}not{/b} porn. There wasn't any sex, even implied, most of the time!"
    C "\"Most of the time\"?"
    T "You don't really understand, Clover; I couldn't even show my characters {b}kissing{/b}. Two girls merely expressing their love is \"deviant behavior\" according to the law!"
    C "Wow, that's seriously crazy!"
    "Middle school me used to be proud of being a \"deviant\", but in truth I never actually was anything more than just another weird goth kid."
    C "(While I was merely playing at being a deviant, Tanya was sincerely forced into the role by everyone around her.)"

    C "(Speaking of which...)"
    C "Why are you telling me all this anyway, Tanya?"
    T "Because I need to tell {b}someone{/b}. Because I thought you'd understand me better than anyone else."

    "The door is already slammed shut behind Tanya before I can even tell her off for rudely dumping her emotions on me then running off just like that."

    C "Sibyl received a text from her this morning telling me that she wasn't going to do her daily training routine, but aside from that I haven't heard anything else about her."
    C "Honestly, if it wasn't for that text, Sibyl probably would have broken her door down to make sure she's all right."

    S "Clover, this way, I see some by the fence posts!"
    "Having thought I was good at running by now, I realize that I'm just not as properly motivated during my daily training as Sibyl is by the excitement of the Easter Egg Hunt right now."
    "Her skill at spotting even the slightest glint of the colorful plastic eggs hidden amongst the verdant Spring grasses or tucked into odd corners among the masonry is impressive."
    "The manner in which she leaves me in her dust as she flies off toward them to scoop each into her basket is even more incredible, given that {b}I'm{/b} the one in a sports club."
    C "Wait, Sibyl, slow down!"
    S "We can't slow down or someone else will find the eggs before us!"
    C "But what about your friend and her—"
    S "{b}Exactly{/b}. We need to find as many as we can before they them all first!"
    "Ultimately, we never see Sibyl's library friend or her Vertu partner again. As the frenzy of pink uniforms subsides, Sibyl and I find a grassy spot beneath a shaded tree where we can count our spoils."
    "When all the colorful plastic egg shells are counted up, Sibyl has easily tripled the haul I brought in during the Easter Egg Hunt."
    C "Malted milk balls? Does anyone under seventy years old like these?"
    S "I'll take 'em!"
    "I spit the half crunched ball of disgust out into the grass, then toss the second unwrapped portion toward Sibyl's waiting open mouth."
    C "I can't believe you actually like those."
    S "But they're good! Unlike black licorice."
    "With her next egg, Sibyl unwraps a cluster of shiny black jelly beans and visibly shivers at the sight."
    C "Ooh, I'll take those!"
    S "\"I can't believe you like those.\""
    "Sibyl fires what I said to her right back at me as she passes off the little black nuggets of delight to my growing collection of candy."
    C "My Dad always loved them, so I guess I kind of grew to like them too. Plus, maybe little goth me felt some kind of kinship to the overlooked but sweet candy dressed in black."
    "For a moment I tense up slightly, realizing that maybe Sibyl doesn't want to hear about me and my normal life with my biological parents, but thankfully she doesn't seem to mind at all."
    S "I once had a foster brother who liked black licorice, so we all gave him ours every year. I think our foster parents just stopped putting any in the eggs after he was adopted."
    "The lollipop in my mouth is a strange savior, but one that I need right not to give me an excuse for taking my time to think over what my reply in this conversation should be."
    C "(Sibyl has never been touchy about being an orphan when we've talked about it before, but I still don't want to accidentally say something rude.)"
    C "Do you do an Easter Egg Hunt with your foster family every year?"
    S "We do! My foster parents hide the eggs the night before, but we're only allowed to start looking for them when we get back from church services."
    S "I wonder who found the most this year? That's usually my win every year."
    "As we lie in the grass gorging ourselves on chocolate and candy, I think back to how little I knew about Sibyl when wt first met, and how little I still know about her now."
    C "(Just a few months ago I was convinced that Sibyl was my soul mate and that I'd never be able to live without her love. What was I {b}thinking{/b}?)"
    "My thoughts about Sibyl as a person haven't particularly changed since then; I still think she's an amazing person and my special Vertu partner."
    "What's changed is that I no longer feel like I have to be any more than that with her. We're friends and Vertu partners. We trust one another and support one another."
    C "(I thought I was madly in love with her then, but I was just weak, and she believed in me even when I didn't believe in myself.)"
    "She was only ever acting as my friend and Vertu partner, but me with my confusing, new-found lusts took our relationship a very different direction all on my on."
    C "I'm sorry, Sibyl."
    C "(I don't love you that way. I probably never truly did.)"
    S "Hmm?"
    "My thoughts and feelings at the moment may be somber, but Sibyl is anything but as she pulls a piece of taffy into a long, sticky length between her fingers and her teeth."
    C "For everything I've put you through before. I'm sorry."
    S "You don't have anything to be sorry about, Clover! Except, well, you {b}could{/b} be nicer to Tanya, so go apologize to her instead."
    C "Yeah..."
    "Even if Sibyl is too kind to want to hear it, I'm glad that I apologized to her anyway."
    "I even feel that, with everything that's happened lately, it's probably a good idea to apologize to Tanya too. After seeing her get bullied like she was, the guilt of how I've treated her in the past has also been eating into me."
    "That's a more bitter jelly bean to swallow given our shared history so far, but with how close we've been — in a manner of speaking — since I joined the lacrosse team, it's probably long overdue."
    "Sibyl and I scrape ourselves off the lush green grass before long, and with a lot to think about, I make for the athletic fields to let some cardio kick start the hard thinking I have to do before tomorrow."

    C "(It's true enough though that things aren't looking so good in the midfield after we lost three midfield specialists to the bullying incident.)"
    "The way she uses Miss Woolsey's first name is also weird, but I chalk it up to a slip of the tongue in the heat of the moment."
    mw "You're absolutely right, Tanya, which is why I am promoting you to Assistant Captain and assigning you to work closely with Clover in re-organizing our fractured midfield."
    T "A-Assistant Captain?"
    mw "Just now, you've stood up to your coach to fight for your teammate's dignity and the welfare of the team. That kind of leadership is exactly why I am assigning you the role, if you will accept it."
    T "I do!"
    "Miss Woolsey stands to leave my side and instead join Tanya, placing her hand upon her shoulders softly as if she were a regent conferring upon Tanya knighthood."
    mw "Congratulations, Assistant Captain Yang. I look forward to hearing about what strategies you both come up with to fortify our midfield, {b}after{/b} Miss Ipswich's two week probation of course."
    T "Yes, Coach Woolsey!"
    C "(One little promotion and all of a sudden she goes from \"Naomi\" to \"Coach Woolsey\" again?)"
    C "Thank you, Coach Woolsey, and... sorry again."
    mw "It's okay to make mistakes as long as you learn from them."
    "Some part of me still feel like I'm getting off particularly, but then again, I only scared off the bothersome girls in the bleachers and didn't actually hurt anyone."
    mw "You're dismissed for today, Clover. Your probation begins immediately."
    mw "As for you, Tanya, you've been through a lot recently and I want you to take a rest from today's practice."
    T "But—!"
    mw "No \"buts\"! I need you in tip top shape for this week's rematch with Snipatuit."
    pause 2.0
    C "This is awkward..."
    "A thick silence falls after Miss Woolsey departs, leaving just me and Tanya alone together in the locker room."
    "I don't want to have to be the one to make the first move, and apparently neither does Tanya, who remains standing nearby against the lockers.."
    C "(Sibyl would be way upset if I didn't take the opportunity, wouldn't she?)"
    "When I clear my throat, Tanya turns her attention toward me like she was expecting it to happen and not that I'm being magnanimous in my current actions."
    C "Umm... thanks for fighting to keep me on the team. I really do want to give everything I have to the Wild Roses."
    T "I didn't do it for {b}you{/b}; I did it for the {b}team{/b}. You're too strong of a player to lose now when our midfield has already been thrown into such disarray."
    "Tanya doesn't even look at my when she replies, instead crossing her arms and turning away to stare down nothing in the corner of the locker room."
    C "(Yeah, I know you need me, but that isn't what made you come running in here, is it?)"
    T "And thank you for getting rid of those girls back there. I thought I could just ignore them, but in the end they were being a problem for everyone else too, weren't they?"
    C "Yeah, they were totally annoying {b}me{/b}, so I made them go away. That's all there is to it, okay?"
    "I try to return my response equally aloof as Tanya's, but mostly fail to be anywhere near convincing in the attempt."
    C "(Those girls really were annoying me! It's really, honestly not like Tanya deserves any of my sympathy after how she treated me the other day!)"
    C "Anyway, is there anything else {b}you{/b} want to apologize for? Maybe something that's been going on for a few days now?"
    T "I don't know, is there anything that {b}you{/b} want to apologize for, Clover? Maybe something that's been going on for a few {b}months{/b} now?"
    "I grit my teeth with firm resolve, not wanting to be the first one between us to have to offer apologies, but also realizing as well that it has to be done sooner or later."
    C "(So we're both prideful; that's what Sibyl said. But there's nothing wrong wth pride, is there?)"
    "Even so, this exchange underscores to me even more clearly how tough of a time Sibyl must have when she's caught between the two unmovable diamond-encrusted steel walls that are me and Tanya."
    C "I was in a lot of turmoil when I first got here, okay? Maybe my attitude wasn't the best, but neither was yours."
    T "You started it."
    C "Do you {b}want{/b} me to apologize or not?"
    T "Go ahead."
    C "I'm sorry, okay? I felt like my whole life— no, my whole {b}universe{/b} was falling apart, and I took it out on everything and everyone around me."
    C "I was wrong to do so, and I know that now. Happy?"
    T "That was really well said, Clover."
    C "Uhh, thanks?"
    T "I mean it. I think that's exactly how I was feeling for the last few days — until just now when you started yelling and pitching balls at those girls cheering in the bleachers just now in fact."
    C "Huh? I don't think anything could shake "
    T "I've always taken pride in being tough and resilient. I never thought a little bullying would make me stumble, but that's exactly what happened that day in the locker room."
    C "So what? They were awful to you. No one deserves that, not even you."
    "Tanya pauses to give me a hard look at my wording, which maybe come out a little too strongly for what I meant to say."
    C "How about, \"not even someone as strong as you\", okay?"
    C "(This strange new world of \"being nice to Tanya\" is going to take some adjustment, even if we haven't exactly been all that mean to each other lately anyway.)"
    T "Those girls {b}were{/b}... particularly cruel, but even so, I expected that I could shrug off whatever they, or anyone else, threw at me."
    C "None of us thought what happened was okay, Tanya. No one blames you..."
    T "Maybe not, but {b}I{/b} blamed {b}myself{/b}! The girl I thought I was should have pushed them away and told them off, at {b}least{/b}."
    T "Instead, I crumbled to pieces and bawled my eyes out in the shower in front of the whole team. I haven't even faced any of them since then, not even from the other side of the cafeteria counter."
    T "You can call it shame, but it was more than that. I've always unquestionably lived {b}my{/b} way, but suddenly I was made to feel so scared and {b}vulnerable{/b} in a way I hadn't been before."
    T "Even today, with my \"fans\" in the crowd, all I could think about was how much they were judging me, how much expectation they had placed on me, and how they were making others on the team view me."
    C "What about them? They don't really care about you, or even know anything at all about lacrosse. They're just the same as your bullies. All they want is to distract from their own shortcoming by taking it out on {b}you{/b}."
    T "Yeah, you're right. Both they and my bullies are just envious of what I have, and only express it in different ways."
    T "In the end it took you eating a two week probation to remind me that I don't have to give a monkey's butt what they want out of me. I'm going to tell my fans to buzz off and demand an apology from those bullies too."
    C "Good, you do that! You might have forgotten it yourself, but the team still respects your abilities, Sibyl still values your friendship, and I still think you're the most super scary girl I've ever met."
    T "Thanks, Clover. I'll think twice next time I feel like murdering you."
    C "That's a joke, right!?"
    "With no more left to say, or at least nothing remaining that we know how to express, we both turn away from one another to change out of our uniforms from either side of the bench where our lockers reside."
    "We change together in the locker room just like this almost every day, but somehow today the awkward silence between us seems even more uncomfortable than usual."
    C "(It's so quiet. What is she thinking?)"
    "After pulling my jersey over my head, I sneakily glance back over my shoulder, only to catch eyes with Tanya who suddenly jerks out of her halted exchange of outfits."
    C "What are you looking at me for?"
    T "Looking at {b}you{/b}? {b}You're{/b} looking at {b}me{/b}!"
    C "I {b}am not{/b}! I'm only looking at {b}you{/b} because you were looking at {b}me{/b}!"
    "My head whips back around in the next fraction of a second, and my body quickly continues the normal routine while my mind attempts to parse the confusion of the awkward exchange moment prior."
    #"My heart beats fast in my chest, just like that type that I momentarily thought my friends and I might have actually summoned a ghost late at night, only to find the source of the mysterious sounds to be the neighbor's cat."
    scene bg hallway with dissolve
    "With my school uniform now re-equipped, I exit the locker room first and am immediately beset by Sibyl just outside the door."
    S "I rushed over when I say Miss Woolsey return to the gymnasium without you or Tanya! Please tell me nothing bad has happened, Clover!"
    C "Relax, Sibyl, we're both fine. Actually, Tanya got out of this way better than me, actually. Miss Woolsey gave me a two week probation."
    S "A two week probation? What does that mean?"
    C "It means I can't play with the team for two weeks."
    S "But you'll be able to play with the team again after two weeks? What'll you do before then?"
    C "Yeah, and Miss Woolsey actually asked me and Tanya to come up with some new plans by the time I return to practice."
    # tanya arrives
    T "Clover is going to help her new Assistant Captain re-organize the midfield now that we lost three of our rank to the kitchen staff."
    "Tanya conveniently emerges from the locker room just in time to pat herself on the back in front of Sibyl, who takes a moment to realize that she's speaking about herself."
    S "Assistant {b}Captain{/b}? Tanya, that's wonderful!"
    "Sibyl even goes so far to lunge herself into Tanya for a hug, which I feel was definitely more owed to the girl who just got a two week probation instead, but do not take the matter up with Sibyl."
    C "(A month ago I might have bounced off the walls to see Sibyl draped across Tanya like this.)"
    "Such thoughts have been disconcertingly common since I've arrived at the academy. Whether it is the growing up they say one does in high school finally reaching me or not, I cannot say."
    "Whatever the case may be, I let Tanya and Sibyl have the moment deserved between close friends, before reeling Sibyl's attention back to state confidently that all this drama has made me hungry."
    S "Good idea! Let's celebrate with an early dinner!"
