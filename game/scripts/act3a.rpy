    "The excitement of Homecoming swiftly fades into the intense boredom of passing the week-long Easter break when most students have left for home."
    "Sibyl surprised me on Sunday by attending services in the academy's chapel. She told me after that she isn't religious, but that the foster family she has been with for the past few years used to take her and her foster sibling every once in a while."
    C "(She probably went only because there's nothing else to do with the whole academy away on break.)"
    "All student activities are on hold, both classes and extra-curriculars. Even the cafeteria is operating with a depressingly limited menu."
    "Sibyl and Tanya both also have chosen to stay behind, leaving the three of us to scrape the bottom of the barrel of activities to entertain us."
    T "Pass me the top coat, Sibyl?"
    S "Here you go!"
    S "Are you almost ready for another coat, Clover?"
    C "Almost."
    "I've always gotten the impression that Sibyl genuinely likes her foster family, so why she hasn't chosen to return home is a bit of a mystery to me."
    "As I lie on my stomach atop my bed waiting for the first coat of black nail polish to dry, I try to think up ways I can subtly ask her about it in a manner that won't sound like I'm prying into her personal business."
    S "That terracotta color looks so good on you, Tanya!"
    T "I was skeptical at first, but it really does, doesn't it?"
    S "What about now, Clover?"
    "Deep, dark, black-hole colored nails are strictly forbidden in the school dress code, but I still have a few days yet before I have to remove it in preparation to start classes again."
    C "(This is probably the only type of painting I've ever been good at. How long has it been since I last painted my nails anyway?)"
    S "Clover?"
    "Realizing that I must be zoning out further than I think I am, I roll off the top of my bed to join the others on the floor and snatch the clear from Tanya."
    C "Sorry, Sibyl. I don't need another coat after all."
    T "I'm so glad you're staying for Easter break, Sibyl. Are you sure your foster family won't mind?"
    "After thinking how best to ask such a personal question to Sibyl, Tanya suddenly outright asks the very same thing I was wondering."
    S "It's only a week, and after seeing how stir-crazy you were after our Christmas break I couldn't do that to you again."
    "It's clear from Tanya's expression that she doesn't like this answer, and Sibyl is quick to alleviate her concerns."
    S "Really, I wanted to stay! The whole reason I applied for this scholarship is to experience all the ups and downs of living out on my own."
    T "Okay, but why is Clover still here? I thought she was finally getting along with her parents again?"
    "That Tanya asks Sibyl instead of me about my own personal life gets on my nerves, so despite how I don't really care to share my personal life with her, now I feel obligated."
    C "I also chose to stay here this week, Tanya."
    "I've told Sibyl all about what happened with my parents' divorce, but given Tanya's dated knowledge of the situation I assume that my roommate hasn't been talking behind my back."
    "Tanya must have realized something was wrong when I suddenly fell apart right before the tryouts, but she usually has enough tact not to shove her face where it doesn't belong."
    C "For your information, my parents' divorce was finalized a few weeks ago. I've accepted that it happened but that doesn't mean I'm prepared to go back to whatever is now to be called \"home\"."
    T "That sounds like you're avoiding your parents to me."
    C "Well I didn't ask your opinion, did I? Why are {b}you{/b} still here?"
    "Sibyl remains uncharacteristically silent when I start trading swipes with Tanya again, merely focusing on applying the final coat of seafoam green she had selected from her shockingly large collection of nail polish that she never wears."
    T "Did you really expect me to fly all the way to Singapore and back again over a one week break?"
    C "Singa-what? I thought you were Chinese?"
    T "I {b}am{/b} Chinese, but my parents and siblings all live in Singapore. We used to go back and forth living between here and there when I was little."
    T "Ever since my older brother's wife had their first child, however, I'm the only one left over here."
    C "Then why don't you go back?"
    "It's obvious that the topic is more than a little touchy for Tanya and she doesn't want to talk about it, so I drop the topic altogether. There's no sense in aggravating Tanya, especially when Sibyl is around to tell us off."

    "After lunch we head to the library as our next means of passing the time away."
    "Sibyl gets lost in her {i}Girls' Mix{/i} back issues while I opt to flip casually through an {i}Archaeology Insights{/i} article issue about the Sumerian priestess Enheduanna."
    C "(She really liked this \"Inanna\" woman, huh?)"
    "A flutter in my peripheral vision from across the table draws my attention away. It's Tanya holding her {i}Sports Annotated{/i} issue open longways from top to bottom."
    C "What are you doing to that magazine?"
    T "Nothing!"
    "Tanya quickly stammers and turns it horizontal again to flip to the next page, which only makes her actions all the more suspicious."
    C "Gimme that."
    T "Hey!"
    "I snatch the magazine from her hands. The cover features some woman in a bathing suit at the beach."
    C "(Maybe there's an article about surfing?)"
    "I flip through all the pages to find whatever might cause Tanya to hold it so awkwardly, and find the center pages of the magazine fit the orientation."
    C "Hmm..."
    "I first cant my head sideways, then turn the hole magazine around like Tanya did before."
    C "(I wonder if she likes blondes?)"
    "It's no surfing article but instead a super big photograph of a blonde-haired model in a bikini that made Tanya flip the whole magazine around."
    C "(No, I don't think this is surfing related at all. Or any sport for that matter.)"
    "The model is pretty, sure, but way too made up for the photoshoot in my opinion."
    S "What's up? Is there a good article in that issue?"
    C "Uhh, just some new lacrosse stick models. You probably wouldn't be interested, Sibyl."
    "I quickly toss the magazine back at Tanya's face, though she predictably catches it before impact and delivers a silent glare my way in return."
    C "Speaking of lacrosse, when are the practices starting up again?"
    T "The first Tuesday after everyone returns from Easter break."
    S "I'm so glad that you're going to continue playing lacrosse, Clover. I just know you're going to be great!"
    C "That's the plan! I can't let Tanya hog all the glory in the midfield."
    T "Maybe if you didn't gorge yourself on French toast every morning you could keep up!"
    C "I {b}told{/b} you that I need that sugar energy!"
    T "You really don't."
    C "Maybe {b}you{/b} don't!"
    S "Let's go find a book about sports nutrition, Clover! There's sure to be one around here somewhere."
    "When we do find the book and finish poring through the impressively dense text, Tanya doesn't hesitate to gloat about being correct the whole time."
    "Tanya thinks she has all the answers about keeping up with her athletics, and admittedly, the results are impressive. That leaves me with only one choice."

    T "What are you doing here, Clover?"
    "Against my better judgement, I manage to drag myself out of the sweet caress of sleep early the next morning to ambush Tanya before she goes out on her morning run."
    C "Training. Since you have {b}all{/b} the answers, I'm gong to do everything you do."
    T "What? No!"
    C "Are you afraid that I'm going to get better than you?"
    T "No, that's never going to happen. I just don't want you bothering me while I'm in the zone."
    C "Then you'd better start taking laps in your room if you don't want me around. Besides, won't the {b}team{/b} play better if {b}I{/b} play better?"
    "I make a big show of warming up to run, which coupled with my flawless arguments immediately changes Tanya's tune without any more need for discussion."
    T "Fine. It's a big field and there's plenty of room for both of us. Besides, you won't be able to keep up with me anyway."
    C "Oh yeah? We'll see about that!"
    "When Tanya starts off, I kick it into high gear to keep up to pace with her. Though she has no music in her ears or anything, she remains focused straight ahead without ever getting distracted."
    C "(Is she counting steps in her head? How does she stay so focused?)"
    "I fight on valiantly, but by the time I'm huffing and puffing with each step, Tanya's still as cool and cucumber-like as when she started."
    "Tanya cleanly finishes her desired number of laps and proceeds off the field to walk a small loop in place as she checks her pulse."
    C "(Seriously, what is with her!?)"
    "I make well sure to finish the exact same amount of circuits as Tanya did, just so she can't hold that over my head too."
    "With the last lap finished, I stagger on shaky legs over to where Tanya rests and flop unceremoniously on my back into the refreshingly cool grass."
    T "Your warm up was adequate, but you need to cool down after running too. If you don't, your muscles will tighten up and become sore."
    C "Shut— Up— Tanya."
    "Despite my nearly-breathless exclamation aide squarely at Tanya, I manage to scrape myself off the ground and walk a few circles around my running partner before flopping back down into the grass."
    T "Here, hydrate."
    C "{b}Urk!{/b}"
    "Tanya responds to my jibe by dropping my water bottle right on top of my stomach, resulting in the rather unpleasant sounding exclamation as it impacts but no lasting damage."

    S "I'm so proud of you, Clover!"
    "Sibyl's praise is even sweeter than the maple syrup-drizzled yogurt parfait that I struggle to shovel into my mouth with the last of my remaining energy."
    T "Today I recorded my fastest time yet."
    S "That's great! Just last week you were telling me that you thought you were stuck in a rut."
    "Neither of us want to admit it for our own selfish reasons, but we both know the only reason Tanya was able to break her record is because I was there to challenge her."
    "After lunch, I fall into a deep food coma and nap so long that I almost miss lunch time were it not for a timely intervention by Sibyl and Tanya."

    T "Good, you're here. I was beginning to think I pushed too har and broke you yesterday. Warm up and grab a stick."
    "Some manner of grumbling quivers my vocal cords but produces only an unintelligible retort to Tanya's upbeat denigration."
    "The cool morning air and the reinvigorated coursing of blood through my body as a result of my warm-ups eventually returns proper English words to my speech."
    C "What are the lacrosse sticks for? Aren't we going to run laps again?"
    T "I wanted to try something a little more tough now that I have a partner. Think you can keep up with me?"
    C "Quit looking down on me, Tanya. You're no better at anything than I am; you just have a head start on training!"
    "Rather than do simple laps around the field, we both grab a stick and run in parallel up and down the length of the field, tossing and catching the ball to one another as we go."
    C "(I am not going to let Tanya brag off to Sibyl at breakfast today! This is the day that I hold my own until {b}Tanya{/b} is the one sobbing into her granola!)"
    "My desired victory ultimately fails to come to fruition, but despite the workout being doubly as intense as the day before, I manage to keep pace all the way until we call it quits."
    C "(This counts as a victory for me, right?)"
    "The twins are waiting on the sidelines to ambush us when we finally finish our training routines. As we greedily gulp down the contents of our water bottles, they silently circle us in opposite directions."
    "With Tanya clearly just ignoring them in favor of wiping off her sweat and re-hydrating, I am forced the be the one who has to speak up to this strange behavior."
    C "Umm... What's happening here?"
    O "We are observing the competition."
    C "Competition?"
    T "Honestly, Clover. If you don't want to play their games, just ignore them."
    "Having been first to strike out against whatever game the twins might be playing, they take the opportunity to pounce around the front and back of Tanya where she stands."
    "Vincenza stops up close to wave her hand across Tanya's face like she might be invisible rather than merely ignored, while her sister Vittoria slides around back to daintily lift the back of her lacrosse kilt - only to realize with a pout that it's a skort."
    T "What are you even doing here? Shoo, shoo."
    "As before, all it takes for Tanya to remove the twins' unwanted incursion is for her to tell them off, though she does reserve a soft flick to the forehead for Vittoria, who probably deserves it."
    H "The Easter break is almost over."
    O "Our flight was moved up at the last moment."
    "It has not gone unnoticed to me how many more girls were populating the cafeteria in the past day. I am not displeased about their return whatsoever, as the quality of the meals served has increased proportionally."
    C "Is this about the whole Homecoming thing? I'm definitely not entering the competition again next year so you have nothing to worry about."
    O "Homecoming?"
    H "Oh, no no no."
    O "We mean, of course, the Student Council."
    H "Who else is more suited to supplant us when we graduate?"
    O "The stoic ace of the lacrosse team..."
    H "...And her lush flower of a girlfriend?"
    C "Girlfriend!?"
    T "You're both {b}way{/b} off base, as usual. I don't even {b}like{/b} Clover, let alone want to be her girlfriend."
    "Somehow, Tanya's words actually hurt me a little after all that hard training we just completed together. I feel that I should have earned at least some amount of her respect, but apparently not."
    C "Y-Yeah, Tanya is the worst. I hate her."
    "I end up throwing what Tanya said about me back at the twins, but really it's more directed at Tanya who started it in the first place."
    H "{b}Tsun—{/b}"
    O "{b}—Dere.{/b}"
    "The twins stare down Tanya directly as they emphasize the first part of their accusatory-sounding words, then turn the spotlight on me for the second half."
    "Perhaps because I don't know the first thing about Italian, I don't take any real offense to whatever it is they're saying about me. Tanya, however, surprisingly loses her customary cool."
    T "You're {b}wrong{/b}!"
    "Tanya whips the equipment bag over her shoulder and storms off without another word, or even waiting for me to follow her back to return the crosse still in my hands."
    C "What was all that about?"
    O "We may have teased her a little too strongly."
    H "Tanya has something of a \"love-hate relationship\" with blondes."
    O "Worry not. We will apologize later."
    "I turn to follow the twins' gazes and take one more glance at the retreating figure of my rival as she stomps off toward the locker room, then make to set the record straight with Vittoria and Vincenza."
    C "Let me first make one thing clear; I'm {b}not{/b} worried about Tanya."
    C "But... What does she have against blondes anyway?"
    O "Has she ever told you about her Vertu partner — Sierra?"
    C "Her Vertu? The girl who is apparently the human incarnation of everything irritating in the world according to Tanya?"
    O "Yes, {b}that{/b} Sierra."
    "It is true that Sierra has blonde hair similar to mine, except that my large sample of secondhand knowledge about her indicates that she's way more difficult of a person than me even on my worst days."
    H "I believe the phrase Tanya used was \"hate-fuck\"."
    C "Like, she hates her, but wants to...?"
    H "Sierra {b}is{/b} quite fetching, isn't she?"
    "Rather than ask the question of me, Vittoria looks toward her sister, who nods her agreement."
    C "(It almost seems like they're implying they'd sleep with anyone who is super pretty, but that can't be true because they slept me someone like me.)"
    "A shiver unrelated to the cool early Spring air washes over me, and I try to push what happened that day completely out of my mind again."
    C "Well I'm not Sierra, so if that's what's behind the problem Tanya has with me, she can leave the attitude back in her dorm room."
    H "Maybe that is enough gossipping for today. We did not come here solely to tease you both."
    O "No, we also wanted to check on you, Clover. You looked exceptionally pale at the Homecoming ceremony."
    C "(So I'm just supposed to be okay with the teasing because you ask me how I'm doing after?)"
    C "Don't be concerned about me. I'm fine — never better in fact."
    "The twins before me are very obviously not satisfied with my answer given the way they look toward one another, so in the interest of getting them off my back I throw them a few scraps to nibble on."
    C "I'm not very good with being in the spotlight, so Sibyl kinda coerced me and Tanya to go to the dance together and use the Homecoming competition as a way for me to face those fears."
    H "I see..."
    "Rather than express any interest whatsoever in what is an admission of a deeply held fear of mine, Vittoria and Vincenza are somehow more interested in Sibyl's role in the whole affair."
    O "So it was not Tanya who asked you to the dance..."
    H "...But rather our pigtailed friend who orchestrated the whole thing?"
    C "Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
    "Vittoria and Vincenza once more turn quiet to stare deeply into one another's eyes for a solid minute and a half."
    C "(This can't be good.)"
    C "I'm... going to go now. Bye."

    "Tanya is already seated when I arrive at breakfast after practice. When I sit down with my own yogurt parfait across from her, she mostly just ignores my presence altogether."

    T "Did Sibyl's hair get tangled in her sleep again?"
    C "What?"
    T "The last time Sibyl missed breakfast it was because her hair was a disaster zone that she was struggling to rebuild."
    "It doesn't at all come as a surprise to find out that Tanya is worrying about Sibyl in the same way I am, but I really wish she didn't have to flaunt how muh more she knows about my Vertu than I do."
    C "I don't know. I showered in the locker room."
    "I try not to look like I'm worried about what is holding up Sibyl, and so too does Tanya despite both of us stealthily glancing toward the doorway every so often."
    "When Sibyl finally does show, it's with two girls on either side of her who aren't either of us."
    "Vittoria and Vincenza flank her on either side, each linking an arm into hers from each flank. Sibyl apparently thinkings it is the most amusing thing ever by how brightly she's smiling."
    "The trio parts gaily at the entryway, the twins splitting off toward the kitchens together while Sibyl steps toward our usual table in the cafeteria."
    "The pair of me and Tanya glaring her direction must be a sight to behold because her cheerful smile breaks into a surprised start when she spots us shooting daggers between her and the twins from across the room."
    S "Good mornin'! Sorry I'm late; I had an audience with the local royalty this morning."
    C "We saw."
    T "What did they want?"
    "Both of us can scarcely conceal our suspicions behind a neutral tone, but that doesn't stop Sibyl from remaining as cheerful as before."
    S "Book recommendations!"
    "It's not just me and Tanya behaving shifty. Sibyl's answer, despite being delivered in a fast and upbeat fashion, is accompanied by a turn of her body away from either of us and the relocation of her gaze onto the table below."
    C "What did you recommend?"
    S "Anne of Green Gables, of course!"
    T "The library has only one copy, and you recommended it to both of them?"
    S "They do everything else together, so why not read together?"
    "Even with both of us trying to subtly interrogate her, Sibyl gives up nothing at all and quickly switches gears toward our plans for the rest of the day."
    C "What makes it a \"break\" if the teachers assign homework over it?"
    S "No whining, Clover! You have to keep your grades up if you want to stay on the lacrosse team."

    T "Where I come from, family is everything, and what we choose to do as individuals often reflects upon the whole family."
    C "Okay, and...?"
    T "When we picked up and moved to Singapore from America, I found I could no longer pursue certain interests of mine publicly. They were \"embarrassing\" the family."
    T "Except there are some things I can't just \"stop\" being, so eventually they sent their embarrassment of a daughter back to America half a world away."
    "She's clearly glossing over something important, but what strikes me is the similarity to my own troubles. Just like I felt like I was abandoned here, so too must Tanya feel like she's abandoned half a world away."
    C "What did they ask you not to do?"
    "Tanya sends me a chilling glare when I dig for more information out of her, but it's toward SIbyl that her gaze edges when she goes to answer."
    T "That's personal and totally outside the scope of the dare."
    C "Fine, but why did your family even move away if they were just going to send you back here anyway?"
    "This question also hits a sore point for Tanya, but surprisingly enough, she answers it anyway."
    T "Because my older brother and his wife work there. When she had their first child, my parents moved there to support them."
    T "I don't think they expected to send me back to America until they realized they had to get rid of their daughter somehow."
    C "(So her parents picked up and moved their whole lives for her brother but dumped Tanya here? How is that fair?)"
    "It's clear from the dark expression on Tanya's face that she doesn't think it's fair at all, and I can't blame her one bit."
    S "Thank you for sharing, Tanya."
    "Tanya grumbles a bit dismissively, as eager to move on as anyone asked to divulge personal history, and spins the pencil herself. The point edges her direction, bringing a small smile back to her face."
    T "Truth or Dare."
    S "Truth."
    "It does not take long for Tanya to come out with a question, and it is a juicy question at that."
    T "Sibyl, did you really, umm... {b}kiss{/b} Clover?"
    "Sibyl stiffens up where she sits, her eyes moving to glance toward me briefly which I imagine to be her askings why I ever told Tanya in the first place, before staring forward blankly as she formulates an answer."
    S "Yes, it is true. I kissed Clover."
    T "{b}Why!?{/b}"
    S "I'm sorry, that's something you should ask Clover."
    "As eager to move on from the awkward question as anyone who answers a difficult question in Truth or Dare, Sibyl sets the pencil spinning at a fast clip which slows upon herself."
    S "What'll it be, Clover? Truth or Dare?"
    "My stomach sinks immediately. Dread floods in to fill the space it left. I know now that this whole game is a ploy to get me and Tanya to open up to one another about our seemingly similar troubles."

    C "Eventually it got so bad that they took me out of my old school one day and told me I was coming here instead. At the time I thought it was some kind of punishment or a total abandonment, but now I know they only did it out of love."

    "Tanya clearly doesn't understand what I'm talking about, and admittedly maybe it doesn't make as much sense when I say what I feel aloud as when I feel what I do inside."

    C "If my parents hadn't sent me here, I'd probably be struggling even worse back home. They were right to do it, however betrayed I felt at the time."

    S "You asked me to kiss you like Clover kissed me, not the other way around!"
    "With the same cheeky grin as before, Sibyl declines to give Tanya back her turn and gets away with another light dare as a result."

    T "God, do you {b}ever{/b} quit it?"
    T "I mean about why I was sent back to America when the rest of my family all moved to Singapore with my older brother."
    T "It's not because I was an embarrassment that had to be excised from the family, but because I can genuinely live the life I want here when I couldn't over there."
    "Now relatively confident that Tanya isn't going to break my skull open with a crosse, I take a seat on the bench running through the aisle of lockers."
    C "What were you even doing that caused all your trouble in the first place? You were being awfully coy about that during Truth or Dare."
    T "I suspect she knows already, but... I haven't told Sibyl that I'm gay, or that I once had a crush on her."
    C "So?"

    T "It doesn't help that I was an awkward middle-schooler self-publishing cringey self-insert {i}manhua{/i} either, but that was the only way I knew how to express myself."

    T "It's like that, but Chinese. I was only self-publishing on the internet, but even then I had to be careful about what I was drawing."
    C "You were drawing porn? I mean, I kinda get why it was embarrassing for your family."
    "My reply is entirely sympathetic to Tanya's plight, having done enough cringey stuff back in middle school to make me want to jump off the nearest cliff right now."

    S "It's the Easter egg hunt!"
    "While listening to our teachers explain the hunt, Sibyl chatters away with her library friend. Her Vertu also shows up eventually, and though I give my greetings, I don't try to join in the conversation all that much."

    "Sibyl's friends, and just about everyone else in line behind us, watch with spellbound attention as the twins play at flirting with me for all to see."
    "Maybe Sibyl's training really did pay off, because more than be unnerved by the attention, I am plainly just annoyed at the twins."
    "Even Vincenza's attempt to unnerve me by tugging at my necktie doesn't bother me. All it does is set the girls behind us atwitter to watch."
    C "Oh, shut it, you know I don't have a fan club."
    "I hiss my reply out quietly so as not to make a scene, and yank at the basket only to find Vincenza release it without a struggle. She only grins at my sharp reply, then adds a soft no of her own."

    H "A moment, please."
    O "Before you run off with Sibyl and her friends."
    "The twins release my arms. The way their voices remain low indicates this isn't a part of their play acting, but something rather more serious. Glancing behind them, I spot the other student council members handing out baskets in their place."
    C "(Can they not do anything any way but the most annoying?)"
    C "Fine, what's up?"
    H "Your fellow Homecoming Queen. Have you seen her?"

    C "(They are the President and Vice President after all. It makes sense they'd be made aware about students who get reprimands, and the cause for it.)"
    C "Tanya was obviously shaken up by the whole ordeal, but put on a brave face for me and Sibyl. She wanted to be alone. We didn't force her to stay with us after the game."
    C "Sibyl received a text from her this morning telling me that she wasn't going to do her daily training routine, but aside from that I haven't heard anything else."
    C "(Honestly, if it wasn't for that text, Sibyl probably would have broken her door down this morning to make sure she's all right.)"
    O "Hmm."
    H "Hmm"
    "The twins take a moment to hum thoughtfully between themselves while exchanging their thoughts through eye contact, as they normally do."
    "Behind me, I can tell the line is getting overly curious watching me chat privately with the academy royalty, and Sibyl is watching with her friends nearby as well."
    C "Can I go now?"
    H "Yes, but we're giving you some homework."
    C "Homework? You're not a teacher!"
    O "It's Student Council homework. We'd like you to go check on Tanya."
    C "Why? If she wants to be alone for a while, I'll let her be alone."
    C "Besides, if you want to know how she's doing, why don't you both go check on her yourselves?"
    H "Do not misunderstand, Clover. You need not report back to us."
    O "We simply request that you support her now, one teammate to another."
    "I try to argue back against their wishes, but when I do they merely return to their usual grandiose manner of pretend speaking, leaving me to not have any choice but accept their wishes or end up making a scene."
    S "What did the twins want?"
    C "They asked how Tanya is doing. I told them I don't really know."
    S "Oh..."
    "Sibyl's face darkens as she questions me about the hushed conversation, but quickly turns around when we reach the starting grounds for the Easter egg hunt on the other side of the chapel."

    S "Clover, this way, I see some by the fence posts!"
    "Having thought I was good at running by now, I realize that I'm just not as properly motivated during my daily training as Sibyl is right now by the excitement of the Easter egg hunt."
    "Her skill at spotting even the slightest glint of the colorful plastic eggs hidden amongst the verdant Spring grasses or tucked into odd corners among the masonry is impressive."
    "The speed with which she leaves me in her dust as she flies off toward them to scoop each into her basket is even more incredible, given that {b}I'm{/b} the one in a sports club."
    C "Wait, Sibyl, slow down!"
    S "We can't slow down or someone else will find the eggs before us!"
    C "But what about your friend and her—"
    S "That's exactly what I'm saying, Clover! We need to find as many as we can before they discover them all first!"
    "Ultimately, we never see Sibyl's library friend or her Vertu partner again that day. As the frenzy of pink uniforms subsides, Sibyl and I find a grassy spot beneath a shaded tree where we can count our spoils."
    "When all the colorful plastic egg shells are counted up, Sibyl has easily tripled the haul I brought in during the same period."
    C "Malted milk balls? Does anyone under seventy years old like these?"
    S "I'll take 'em!"
    "I spit the half crunched ball of disgust out into the grass, then toss the second unwrapped portion toward Sibyl's waiting open mouth."
    C "I can't believe you actually like those."
    S "But they're so good! Unlike black licorice."
    "With her next egg, Sibyl unwraps a cluster of shiny black jelly beans and visibly quivers at the sight."
    C "Ooh, I'll take those!"
    S "\"I can't believe you actually like those.\""
    "Sibyl fires what I said to her right back at me as she passes off the little black nuggets of delight to my growing collection of candy."
    C "My Dad always loved them, so I guess I kind of grew to like them too. Plus, maybe little goth me felt some kind of kinship to the overlooked but sweet candy dressed in black."
    "For a moment I tense up slightly, realizing that maybe Sibyl doesn't want to hear about me and my normal life with my biological parents, but thankfully she doesn't seem to mind at all."
    S "I once had a foster brother who liked black licorice, so we all gave him ours every year. I think our foster parents just stopped putting any in the eggs after he moved out."
    "The lollipop in my mouth is a strange savior, but one that I need right now to give me an excuse for taking my time to think over what my reply in this conversation should be."
    C "(Sibyl has never been touchy about being an orphan when we've talked about it before, but I still don't want to accidentally say something rude.)"

            S "They did not talk about it much, but over time I was able to glean that they joined the foster system because they were unable to have children of their own."

    "My thoughts about Sibyl as a person haven't particularly changed since then; I still think she's an amazing person and my special Vertu partner."

    "I even feel that, with everything that's happened lately, it's probably a good idea to apologize to Tanya too. After seeing her get bullied like she was, the guilt of how I've treated her in the past has also been eating into me."
    "That's a more bitter jelly bean to swallow given our shared history so far, but with how close we've been — in a manner of speaking — since I joined the lacrosse team, it's probably long overdue."
    "Sibyl and I pick ourselves up off the lush green grass before long, and with a lot to think about, I make for the athletic fields to let some cardio kick start the hard thinking I have to do before tomorrow."

    "With some pride, a thought passes through my brain that my shots were surprisingly accurate for how off the cuff I had been pulling the balls out of the basket and firing away."
    "But then the reality of what I've done comes back, and I find that not only is Sibyl in the bleachers gaping at me in shocked silence, but so is the entire rest of the lacrosse team behind me, and Coach Woolsey too."
    "It's not the shock or judgement in their eyes that makes me seize up just like everyone else, but mostly just their stares alone, all frozen on me."
    C "(I thought I was over this!)"
    "My hands which had formerly been clenched tightly around my stick with fury now release it to clatter noisily on the gymnasium floor beneath me."
    C "U-Uhhm..."
    "Nothing more is said. Instead, I opt to whip around away from their penetrating stares to spring full steam back to the locker room where a thick wall shields me from their boring gazes."

    C "Hyah!"
    "A pitiful little squeal erupts from my lips at the sudden sound of Ms. Woolsey calling my name, making me jump with surprise to know that she's already tracked me here."

    C "(Well of course she would; I just attacked the girls on the bleachers!)"
    "I don't think any more blood could drain from my face in the exact same moment and still have enough left to keep my brain functioning, and maybe that's accurate because it sure doesn't seem to be functioning properly anymore at all."
    mw "Clover, I'm not mad."
    "Rather than be the pillar of fury that she was that day less than a week ago in this same room, Coach Woolsey's expression is only full of concern for me."
    "Her stability actually works wonders to calm my erratic mental state. Without a word, she leads me to the row of benches between the lockers where we both sit."
    C "I'm sorry. What I did was wrong."
    mw "Yes, it was."
    "The way Ms. Woolsey accepts and agrees with the blame I cast on myself feels like swallowing a boulder, and all I can do is hang my head in shame."
    C "(There goes my lacrosse career... over before it ever started.)"
    mw "I am sorry too. Some of the blame is on me; I should have asked those girls to leave sooner."
    "It's a surprise to me to hear Ms. Woolsey take the blame right back from me, especially since she was a total bystander and I was the one hurling rubberized balls into the bleachers with all my might."
    C "So you're not going to punish me?"
    "For just a moment, I dare to hope, but when I look up from the ground to meet Ms. Woolsey's face, the smile there isn't quite so forgiving."
    mw "You may have have been acting in defense of your friend, but that does not mean you can walk away cleanly from the consequences of your actions."
    "Somehow, my head hangs even lower than before while I await my sentencing. In fact, it probably is at a very good angle to get a clean slice when the guillotine comes down."
    mw "I'll talk it over with the school board, but I think two weeks of athletic probation should do."
    C "Probation?"
    mw "You will take those two weeks to think upon on your actions and how they reflect on the Wild Roses as a team. During this time, you will not be taking part in any games or practices."
    C "So you're... not booting me off the team?"
    "Finally, a real, genuine smile comes to Ms. Woolsey's lips, and that in concert with the slightly-less-than-catastrophic punishment lightens my mood in turn."
    mw "No. I rather believe that having you remain on the team is probably what is best for Tanya right now."
    mw "And don't think I haven't noticed how hard both of you have been training every morning, nor how well in concert you both played during our last game."
    C "You were watching me?"
    mw "I'm watching over every one of my students, Clover, on and off the field. I told you that the very first day you arrived."
    "Despite how kind and friendly her words may sound, they leave a bitterness in my mouth as I remember how rude and disrespectful I was the day I first met my now lacrosse coach."
    mw "I may not have been paying quite as much attention to Tanya of late as I should have, however. Tell me, how is she holding up?"
    C "Well, she's—"
    "\"Off\" is what I'm about to say to call her, but before I can get the words out, the girl herself bursts into the locker room to demonstrate it for herself."
    T "Naomi, you {b}can't{/b} kick Clover off the team!"
    "Both Ms. Woolsey and I gawk back at Tanya in stunned silence, who in contrast to us is red to the face and still catching breaths through her rapid speech."
    T "She may be stupid and annoying, but she's also worked incredibly hard to become a true asset to the Wild Roses that we cannot afford to lose."
    "I'm flattered, in some ways, by what Tanya expresses so emphatically, and also understandably a little peeved in others."
    C "(It's true enough though that things aren't looking so good in the midfield after we lost three midfield specialists to the bullying incident.)"
    "The way she uses Ms. Woolsey's first name is also weird, but I chalk it up to a slip of the tongue in the heat of the moment."
    mw "You're absolutely right, Tanya, which is why I am recommending you to the team for Assistant Captain and assigning you to work closely with Clover in re-organizing our fractured midfield."
    T "A-Assistant Captain?"
    mw "Just now, you've stood up to your coach to fight for your teammate's dignity and the welfare of the team. That kind of leadership is exactly why I am offering you the role, if you will accept it."
    T "I do!"
    "Ms. Woolsey stands to leave my side and instead join Tanya, placing her hand upon her shoulders softly as if she were a regent conferring knighthood upon Tanya."
    mw "Congratulations, Assistant Captain Yang. I look forward to hearing about what strategies you both come up with to fortify our midfield, {b}after{/b} Miss Ipswich's two week probation of course."
    T "Yes, Coach Woolsey!"
    C "(One little promotion and all of a sudden she goes from \"Naomi\" to \"Coach Woolsey\" again?)"
    "The promotion isn't official without the rest of the team agreeing, of course, but it's hard to imagine them not going along with Coach Woolsey's recommendation after everything Tanya's been through lately and how much she means to the team."
    C "Thank you, Coach Woolsey, and... sorry again."
    mw "It's okay to make mistakes, Tanya, so long as you learn from them."
    "Some part of me still feels like I'm getting off particularly light from this whole incident, but then again, I only scared off the bothersome girls in the bleachers and didn't actually hurt anyone."
    mw "You are dismissed for today, Clover. Your probation begins immediately."
    mw "As for you, Tanya, you've been through a lot recently and I want you to take a rest from today's practice."

    C "This is awkward..."
    "A thick silence fills the locker room after Ms. Woolsey departs, leaving just me and Tanya alone together in the locker room."
    "I don't want to have to be the one to break the silence, and apparently neither does Tanya, who remains standing motionless nearby against the lockers."
    C "(Sibyl would be way upset if I didn't take the opportunity, wouldn't she?)"
    "When I clear my throat, Tanya turns her attention toward me like she was expecting it to happen and not like I'm being magnanimous in my current actions."
    C "Umm... thanks for fighting to keep me on the team. I really do want to give everything I have to the Wild Roses."
    T "I didn't do it for you; I did it for the team. You're too strong of a player to lose now when our midfield has already been thrown into such disarray."
    "Tanya doesn't even look at my when she replies, instead crossing her arms and turning away to stare down nothing in the corner of the locker room."
    C "(Yeah, I know you need me, but that isn't what made you come running in here, is it?)"
    T "And thank you for getting rid of those girls back there. I thought I could just ignore them, but in the end they were being a problem for everyone else too."
    C "Yeah, they were totally annoying {b}me{/b}, so I made them go away. That's all there is to it."
    "I try to return my response equally aloof as Tanya's, but mostly fail to be anywhere near convincing in the attempt."
    C "(Those girls really were bothering me though. Tanya honestly deserves none of my sympathy after how she treated me the other day.)"

    T "I don't know, is there anything that {b}you{/b} want to apologize for, Clover? Maybe something that's been going on for a few {b}months{/b} now?"
    "I grit my teeth with firm resolve, not wanting to be the first one between us to have to offer apologies, but also realizing as well that it has to be done sooner or later."

    C "None of us thought what happened was okay, Tanya. No one blames you..."
    T "Maybe not, but {b}I{/b} blamed {b}myself{/b}! The girl I thought I was should have pushed them away and told them off."
    T "Instead, I crumbled to pieces and bawled my eyes out in the shower in front of the whole team."

    T "Even today, with my \"fans\" in the crowd, all I could think about was how much they were judging me, how much expectation they had placed on me, and how they were making others on the team view me."
    C "What about them? They don't really care about you, or even know anything at all about lacrosse. You said that yourself."
    C "Those girls I chased away are just the same as your bullies. All they want is to distract from their own shortcoming by taking it out on you."
    "Tanya already knows everything I'm telling her. In fact, I'm basically just reminding her of what she told me and Sibyl when this whole drama first started."
    T "It took you eating a two week probation to remind me that I don't have to give a monkey's butt what they want out of me."
    T "I won't let your sacrifice go to waste. I'm going to tell my fans to buzz off and demand an apology from those bullies too."
    C "I thought I told you that I did all that for myself? Now you must do your part too."
    C "You might have forgotten it until just now, Tanya, but the team still respects your abilities, Sibyl still values your friendship, and I still think you're the most super scary girl I've ever met."
