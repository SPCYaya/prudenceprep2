    "Determined to ease Sibyl's mind, and to get her to cease giving me such a pitying look, I manage to scramble back up onto my pitiful aching legs once again."

    S "Look how happy she is! Doesn't she look like a rabbit, Tanya?"
    "The way that I attempt to savor the amount of churros I've allotted for myself by making lots of tny nibbles evidently just makes for an amusing sight to Sibyl."
    "When I look up from my delicious fried treat, I catch a glimpse of even a small grin touching the corner of Tanya's lips."

    C "Don't you worry, I feel great! Check this out! I'm burning that big breakfast off right now to make room for lunch!"
    "Not only to do I show off jogging in place, but I do it a the same time as I carefully bounce a badminton shuttlecock up and down with my racket."
    "It's honestly only an accident when it takes an odd bounce off my racket and smacks Tanya right on her forehead."
    C "Sorry. Accident."
    "Sibyl takes a worried glance between me and Tanya, but rather than get immediately angry, Tanya merely picks the shuttlecock off the ground and whips it right back at my face in return."
    T "Watch it, you dullard."
    C "Make me, you brute!"
    "Though we trade barbs much as we have always done in the past, the malice just isn't there like it had been before. Even Sibyl is comfortable enough with the exchange now to smile through it."
    T "Watch it, or I will!"
    "We both trade throws pelting each other with the light plastic shuttlecock as Sibyl looks on until Miss Woolsey gives us a stern glare from across the gymnasium as if to say \"quick goofing off and get back to the lesson at hand\"."
    C "So anyway, Tanya, we still need to work on a plan to present to Coach Woolsey by the end of next week."
    T "I know. I've been thinking about it already. I have art club with Sibyl tomorrow, so maybe we can do some brainstorming on Friday?"
    C "Yeah, let's do that!"
    "A distracting motion catches the corner of my eye, which I find to be Sibyl nearby, silently twirling her racket in her hands as Tanya and I talk to one another."
    "When I look her way, she shows me an encouraging smile that wasn't there a moment before."
    C "...And maybe we should do it in the library. Sibyl can help find some books for us to reference."
    S "I'd be very happy to help if I can!"
    "It's at this mention that Sibyl step forward, the small smile now a full grin spread across her face."
    T "Miss Woolsey never said we couldn't enlist some outside help. Besides, you're basically part of the team anyway with how you're always spectating our practices and cheering on our games."
    S "That is exactly right!"
    "We quickly pick back up with our casual volley of the shuttlecock over the net stretched across the gym floor before Miss Woolsey catches us talking again, but all the while my thoughts are left on Sibyl."
    C "(Is she feeling... left out?)"
    "It's no overstatement to say that I am quite possibly spending more time with Tanya now than I am with Sibyl, not counting the time passed asleep in the same room."
    "It was Sibyl who encouraged me to join the lacrosse team and get closer to Tanya, and I don't think she is showing any regrets about that, but it also must be tough for her to have her two best friends share a hobby in which she cannot participate."

    O "I played the part all right. Our whole athletics class saw me princess carry her out of the gymnasium, even if they didn't see my legs go all wobbly just outside the door. We both ended up on the floor half way down the hallway."
    O "No, Vittoria thinks she knows best because she's the older twin between us. She's always acted like being alive a minute longer on this Earth makes her more mature than me."
    O "Today, that means sending me away because she doesn't want me to be stuck sitting around in the nurse's office with her."
    C "(That sounds reasonable to me. I wouldn't want to be stuck twiddling my thumbs in the nurse's office either.)"
    C "And... how do you feel about that?"
    "It might be a probing question, but Vincenza seems like she's in the mood to unload a little of her emotions, and I am certainly getting more than a little interested in this new side of her relationship to her sister now."
    C "(I thought the two of them were of the exact same mind before, or close enough to it, but they might seriously be two different people after all.)"
    O "I want to stay by her side. I don't care if it's boring in the nurse's office or about whatever the student council has happening today."
    C "I'm sure she has her reasons. I mean, if you're both close enough to have sex together with another girl... Well, I don't know exactly what to say about that, but you probably understand."
    O "Vittoria doesn't like to say \"have sex together\". She prefers \"have sex with the same girl\"."
    C "What's the difference?"
    O "Less guilt about us enjoying intimacy together."
    C "I don't get it. Just don't have sex together if you're going to feel guilty about it."
    O "Clover, the point is that Vittoria doesn't like people asking those kinds of questions, and you shouldn't be asking them either."
    C "So if I go ask her about it right now..."
    O "I'm not joking, Clover. You must not mention any of this to her."
    C "I'm reading you loud and clear, Vincenza."
    "Maybe it's because English is her second language, but she doesn't even pick up that my response was entirely absent of any promises to do as she asks."
    C "Well, I should be going to pick up Sibyl and Tanya soon I think."
    O "Tanya? I won't keep you waiting. Go get her!"

    "The nurse sighs dejectedly but does not fight Vittoria's wishes. Instead, she steps aside to allow me past her toward the bed where Vittoria lies pensively."

    H "So you came running to check on me? What wonderful {i}kouhai{/i} I have!"
    C "Y-Yeah..."
    "I really did intend to come in here and ask her the questions that Vincenza told me not to ask, but now that she's giving me this unintentional guilt trip it's hard to come out with it."
    C "She said something about your ankle?"
    H "Yes. We simply chased after the same tennis ball at the same time and ran right into one another! Sometimes thinking in sync does not work out very well."
    H "It is only a minor injury. I will be back to my student council duties shortly, and in the mean time I have instructed Vincenza on how to fill in for me."
    C "So your normal student council work is moping under the statue out in the garden?"
    "There's a moment where Vittoria processes what I'm saying, upon which her expression turns sour."
    H "I gave Vincenza {b}specific{/b} instructions!"
    C "Well, what do you want me to tell you? She's not following them. She's upset about how you kicked her out of the nurse's office."
    H "God knows I would rather be out there with her and not lying here in the infirmary, but {b}someone{/b} has to do our nightly rounds!"
    "I shrug my shoulders casually. Whatever their duties as President and Vice President entail, it's not my concern and I'm not volunteering to help out with them. I came here for a different reason."
    C "Why did you and Vincenza have sex with me together?"
    H "This again? Clover, you {b}literally begged{/b} us to do it. Don't go regretting it now after we tried to warn you."
    C "I didn't say I regret it, okay?"
    H "Is that so? Did you come here because you want to go again? You picked the absolute worst day for it, Clover."
    "Vittoria takes what I'm asking a completely different direction than what I intended, but it's hard to just come out and tell her that's not what I meant when just the mere suggestion turned her gloomy expression into such a bright, blushing grin."
    H "If Vincenza were here and I weren't stricken lame, we'd definitely—"
    "I cover my eyes to muffle the sounds of whatever shocking things Vittoria says she wants to do to me, but I can still see her lips move and vaguely make out some of the details."
    "When she finally finishes speaking, I release my ears, at which points she tacks on an additional offer for me to consider."
    H "Maybe this time you want to try it on us too. Don't worry, I can teach you how to do it perfectly, and Vincenza won't mind playing test subject."
    C "U-Umm, actually, Vittoria, that's not what I was asking..."
    H "Eh?"
    "The thought of maybe going another round with Vittoria and Vincenza does kind of excite me at some base level, but my memory of the hollow feeling which came after eclipses the lascivious heights attained in the moment."
    C "I meant, like, why you do it with your sister. I don't have a sister myself, but if I did I probably wouldn't be going around having sex with random girls with her."
    C "You didn't even entertain the thought of sex without Vincenza with you."
    "Vittoria quickly turns more beet red to the face than when she was actively detailing how she and her sister were going to go about {i}bleep{/i}ing my {i}bleep{/i} and other such lewd acts."
    H "W-We don't— I mean, when we get in the mood, it's better that there's... another girl."
    "Vittoria stumbles over her word in rapid succession in a way that I've never seen out of her before. It's rewarding to see someone who usually teases me so mercilessly fumbling over herself, even if I have no idea what she's rambling on about."
    "She does eventually collect herself enough to try to reply in a more coherent way which sounds more diplomatic and less emotional than her last."
    H "Clover, I don't know what Vincenza told you, but she and I are twin sisters, and things which may not seem normal to a typical pair of sisters do not feel so strange when we have been so close by one another our whole lives."
    C "So what you're saying is that it's not that awkward between you when you do it?"
    "With a heavy sigh, Vittoria merely says \"yes\", and repeats it again right after."
    H "Yes. When we make love to another girl at the same time, there's nothing... {b}taboo{b} about it at all. It is only a small amount of — what is the word? — \"skinship\", no different from how we wash each other's hair every morning."
    H "If that's all you were wondering about, I'm glad that was cleared up, Clover."
    "I've always thought Vittoria was the maybe slightly less weird of the two, but Vincenza was right that something about it really set her off into the loco zone. She's never been this quick to shut me up before."
    C "Huh. Okay."
    H "But if things don't work out with Tanya, the offer stills stands for us...!"
    C "Tanya? What about her? Are you and Vincenza doing \"that stuff\" with her too?"
    H "I meant between you and Tanya. We heard from her that you finally apologized so—"
    C "What do you mean, \"finally\"? She apologized to {b}me{/b} too!"
    H "If I know both of you, I do not doubt both of you had a lot to apologize for."
    H "Now that you both have apologized, however, it is the perfect opportunity to take your friendship to the next level, don't you think?"
    C "Yeah, we are?"
    H "You are!? She didn't tell us that!"
    C "Yeah. We've more or less stopped fighting and we're going to be working together on drafting plans to re-work the Wild Roses' midfield strategies tomorrow in the library."
    H "Oh?"
    "Vittoria's tone falls flat as she droops back into the nurse's office cot."
    C "Yeah. Me, Tanya, and Sibyl are going to meet in the library tomorrow after class to start brainstorming."
    H "Hmm..."
    "The door suddenly clicks back open, and in walks the nurse again, who looks just as frazzled as when she left but now pushes along a wheelchair before her."

    C "This is a pentagram ritual, not a summoning circe, and barely even that. The blue candle needs to be where the orange candle is, and where that would leave the orange candle needs to be replaced with a white candle."
    "Having participated in my share of pentagram rituals, this much is obvious to me as first glance. I only realize how crazy I must sound when I notice both Tanya and Miss Izzie staring at me in stunned silence."
    C "(Dang it, Clover, that stuff was supposed to stay buried in your past!)"
    C "...Or something. I read a book about it once."
    mi "Can I borrow Clover next time we try it, Tanya?"
    T "Why are you asking {b}me{/b}? I don't own her."
    T "And I see what you're trying to do here, by the way. I told you all that it's not like that."
    mi "What {b}I'm{/b} doing? Why, I am helpfully providing a place for two of my students to work on their extra-curricular assignments! The student council has high hopes of the Wild Roses this year!"
    "Nevermind whatever Tanya and Miss Izzie seem to be arguing about, I get right to work unpacking my bag, prompting Tanya to do the same after some feet dragging."
    C "Come here and brainstorm with us, Miss Izzie. I'm sure you have lots of good ideas too."
    "I'm totally confident in my plans, but it doesn't hurt to have someone with experience on your side, and Miss Izzie is probably the most fanatic supporter of the team out of anyone."
    "She looks like she totally wants to yank a chair right up the table with us, but with a bite to her lower lip she only tells us that she has other matters to attend to and cannot join in."
    mi "I have a very important staff meeting starting exactly... {b}right now{/b}."
    T "How convenient."
    "Miss Izzie's shadow has already disappeared from the doorway before Tanya ever finishes her rebuttal."
    C "Miss Izzie sure is strange."
    T "You don't know the half of it."
    C "I guess you do see a lot of her from the arts club, huh?"
    T "Yeah, I see her a lot in the arts club."
    "After confirming exactly what I thought, Tanya goes about extinguishing the candles and is about to shut off the smooth jazz as well before I stop her."
    C "Keep it on. I like background music when I'm thinking."
    "Without being able to bring my smartphone with me outside the bedroom, I am unable to play my music while studying in the library. Even when I'm at my desk in my room, I still don't put it on speaker like I used to out of respect for Sibyl."
    C "(Sibyl probably wouldn't appreciate the louder screamo bands I was fond of in middle school. It's probably time that I get into more adult music like jazz.)"
    "When Tanya finally reaches her seat opposite mine at the desk, I pull out a pen and flip to a blank page in my notebook to illustrate the plans I've been cultivating in my head."
    C "So here, take a look at this. Before that last game, we've been mostly playing two-way midfield all the way through, right?"
    T "Uh huh."
    C "But in that match, we switched to an offensive and defensive setup which worked well."
    "As I scribble my thoughts out onto the crude sketch of a lacrosse field, I suddenly realize that what is in my brain isn't all that well visualized by the mad scribbles coming out of my pen."
    C "I think we should keep at it. We keep one offensive midfielder and station her here, one defensive midfielder stationed here, and finally place one two-way in the middle."
    T "To cover the OM and DM on either side of the field."
    C "Exactly!"
    T "And the DM gets a long stick?"
    C "Of course!"
    "Happily enough, Tanya appears to be following me step for step even with my sub-par drawing skills."
    C "(Is this how Vittoria and Vincenza feel with on another all the time?)"
    T "It's a good plan, Clover. I assume you put yourself into the DM position here?"
    C "Yeah. I was thinking you'd play well in the two-way role."
    T "Even though I'm the best shot taker in our midfield lineup?"
    C "That's true, but you're also the strongest player when it comes to the stamina necessary to play two-way the full sixty minutes, if necessary."
    C "Even if you won't be able to get as many many shots in, I think the two-way is the most important player on the field since she's covering for the OM and DM on pressure, as well as keeping herself open to intercept passes or advance the ball."
    "Tanya's marble-like brown eyes flicker over the scribbles between us as she pauses to think in silence. After a moment she reaches out to tap my hand, which confuses me until I realize she just wants my pen."
    T "You have us more or less lined up in the midfield. What if we put two OMs up font in parallel with the DM in back, forming a triangle like this?"
    "Dreadful memories of geometry class return to me as Tanya scribbles a triangle over my earlier scribbles, but it's something else entirely that captures my attention."
    C "You smell good."
    T "What?"
    "With Tanya having leaned closer to me over the desk to draw on my notebook, I get a pleasant whiff of something earthy and floral radiating off of her. I have to lean in slightly further just to catch it again."
    T "Stop that!"
    C "Lavender and... something. Is that your shampoo?"
    T "Lavender and rosemary. It's my SPF moisturizer."
    T "You should be wearing a high SPF too, Clover. It's more important than ever to take care of your skin now that we are spending much more time outside."
    C "You're probably right. After the last game, the skin on my neck was that type of red that goes white when you press on it."
    T "That's {b}sunburn{/b}, Clover!"
    C "But it didn't hurt. It was just kinda red."
    T "You need to go down to the academy store and buy some sunscreen. It's a miracle your skin has remained so smooth and clear when you mistreat it as much as you do."
    C "(She's complimenting me! {b}Tanya{/b} is complimenting me.)"
    "I let myself soak into the rare moment of praise from Tanya. Even if it is delivered by way of chastisement, I know that she only means well in wanting me to take care of my skin better."
    C "(There's no way I can tell her that my skin only stayed so fair because I used to carry that all-black, lace-trimmed parasol around with me everywhere I went.)"
    "Tanya eventually drags me back around to the scribbles on the sheet of paper between us and the task at hand, but not before telling me not to cry to her when I look like a prune before the age of thirty."
    C "Oh, yeah, I guess that you could do that, but then there'd be a big gap in the middle of the field and the DM won't have any support."
    T "If you're able to throw accurate, long distance passes like you did during the last game, moving the ball up through the dead zone won't be a problem."
    C "Maybe, but I'm not personally even a starting player, remember? And if most of our midfield is pushed so far forward, it makes it easier for the other team to pass around the DM and into the defensive zone."
    "It takes another half dozen pages full of wavy scribbles, long arcing arrows, and labelled circles for us to come to an agreement on the first draft of our grand midfield lacrosse plans."
    "Despite how much back and forth we do, it actually doesn't take all that much time. Izzie returns before long to check on how we're progressing, but we're already done."
    mi "Ooh, show me what ya got!"
    "Tanya takes the lead in explaining our plan to Miss Izzie while I try to point to each mentioned piece in the most sane set of doodles in my notebook."

    C "Don't remind me!"
    O "We can't tell you what to think of Tanya, or what you want to do with her. You need to come to terms with your feelings on your own."
    C "Gah! You're no help at all!"
    "It is quite frustrating to hear that I'm on my own from the two girls who like to pretend that they know anything and everything, but somehow I know that they're advice is correct."
    C "(I should probably be thankful that Vittoria and Vincenza aren't just messing with my vulnerability, but I did hoped they could just tell me something to fix everything nice and easy.)"
    "The realization and acceptance that I'll have to do some actual soul-searching makes my heart sink deep into my stomach."
    C "Fine, maybe I need to work out exactly what I'm feeling for Tanya myself, but what about {b}her{/b}?"
    O "What {b}about{/b} her?"
    C "Why did she, umm... not freak out when I almost tried to kiss her!?"
    H "Tanya has always been vulnerable to blondes."
    O "I might even dare to suggest that's why she's so hard on you."
    H "Honestly, Clover, don't you have {b}any{/b} idea how irresistibly alluring you are?"
    C "You can't be serious. {b}Tanya{/b}? You think she wanted to kiss me too!?"
    H "You're basically all she talks about anymore. It's really cute actually."
    O "We don't think she even realizes how much she's smiling when she tells us the latest thing that you did to bother her."
    "I don't want to believe anything that Vittoria and Vincenza are saying. My mind is telling me it can't be true, but the heat radiating from my face does not lie."
    "Amidst my silence, the twins turn their heads to bore into each others' eyes, then each reach out to place a single hand comfortingly on each of my shoulders."
    O "We cannot give you all the answers, Clover."
    H "Love is difficult. We have not yet solved that problem either."
    O "Tanya, also, may need more time to work out her feelings."
    H "When you do come to a conclusion, you should talk to her about it."
    O "Until then, do not be afraid to come to us with any concerns."
    H "Do not also forget about your lovely Vertu partner and thoughtful dorm mother."
    O "Skip asking Miss Izzie for advice until after you've worked things out with Tanya."
    C "(Huh?)"
    H "Best of luck, Clover! We're rooting for you!"
    "Arm in arm and with a satisfied look on their faces, the twins leave me with what little answers they have given and a few new questions to pile atop the mountain of unknowns growing within my brain."

    C "(I may have... a tiny crush on Tanya.)"
    "That much I can come to grips with given what happened on my bed that day, and the subsequent dream I had featuring Tanya in much more flattering manner than months past."
    "There's only one particular thing giving me trouble, and that's how differently I feel about Tanya than I did about Sibyl."

    "The way I went about things the first time did not work out as I had hoped at all, so I opt to take the new approach that the twins had laid out before me this time."
    "I plan to simply go about my normal life to give Tanya time to think about her own feelings before I ask about hers, just as Vincenza and Vittoria suggested to me."
    C "(Here I go taking their advice again. Ugh.)"
    "That I am able to spare myself agonizing over what the outcome might be until I get a chance to talk to Tanya about it is probably the best part of the plan and why I'm even entertaining it."
    C "(She sure is taking her time in coming around, though...)"
    "A single day of Tanya acting like nothing happened is something I can handle. A second day of giving her time to figure out her feelings is understandable given the gravity of the situation."
    "By the third day, there's no way she cannot feel the holes I'm boring in the back of her head with my eyes, though she doesn't give even the slightest indication that anything whatsoever is amiss."
    "That's why, on the fourth day, I unilaterally decide that she's had enough time and develop a plan to finally force the issue."
    C "Sibyl, can you help me find this book?"
    "{i}I need to talk to Tanya alone. Can you make sure she doesn't leave when I try to talk to her?{/i}"
    "My Vertu partner is happily quick to recognize my scheme, and passes back the scrap of paper containing the note for her."
    "{i}I KNEW something was up with you two! Leave it to me!{/i}"
    "I do my best to transmit a message of thanks with my eyes while Tanya remains deep in thought ciphering over tactics for the midfield that we can try in our next practice session."
    S "Tanya, can you lend me your badge to check out a book? I left mine in my room."
    "Tanya doesn't even look up when she passes her ID badge — and room key — to Sibyl, who prances off quickly with only a devious little \"thanks\" and a wink my way."
    C "May I borrow your pencil, Tanya?"
    T "No, I'm using it."
    C "(She lent Sibyl her key card without a single thought, but she won't even look up from her notebook when I ask to borrow her pencil she is baerly even using!)"
    "For just a moment, I think that maybe everything I thought about what Tanya must be feeling could be wrong, but then I remember that Vincenza mused she might be so mean to me precisely because she has those feelings."
    C "Fine, no beating around the bush. Something weird happened between you and me, and I want to talk about it."
    T "Alright, Clover, let's talk about it."
    "Tanya is so nonchalant that I am left simply flabbergasted by the ease with which she agrees to hear me out."
    C "(I suffered for days and lured her out to somewhere she can't make a scene, all for her to be as cool as a fricking frozen cucumber!)"
    "I expected this to be a huge ordeal, but instead she just puts her pencil down and stares at me with those deep brown eyes. I'm so thrown off that I don't even know where to start."
    T "You {b}have{/b} thought about it since then, haven't you? I've been waiting for you to process it yourself."
    C "Waiting for {b}me{/b}!? {b}I've{/b} been waiting for {b}you{/b}!"
    "Knowing that we're still in the library after all, I manage to keep my voice down low enough not to cause a disturbance, though I do rise out of my chair slightly with how forcefully I am whispering back to Tanya."
    T "You don't have a great track record with your mental capabilities. I thought you'd need more time than this, if you ever managed to realize what almost happened that is."
    "There's a brief moment where a small flare of annoyance ignites within me as Tanya again tells me I'm stupid to my face, but I try to remember that she and I both know I only realized I had a crush on Sibyl when she told me herself."
    C "(\"What almost happened...\")"
    C "We almost... kissed."
    T "...We almost kissed."
    "As she repeats what I say, Tanya suddenly transforms into a girl I've never seen before."
    "A delicate pink hues touches her rounded cheeks, her eyes flit away from my face, and her fingers find something interesting to ruffle through in the shiny locks of her jet black hair."
    "This new and bashful Tanya is all so irresistibly..."
    C "(Cute!)"
    "The instantaneous urge to jump across the table and make the kiss that almost happened official surges within me. I manage to stuff it back down for the time being, but take solace in that it means my feelings for Tanya truly exist."
    C "I \"like\" you, Tanya."
    C "You used to be the bane of my fricking existence, or so I thought, but somehow I've come to realize that most everything I can do now is because you helped me to it along the way."
    C "Every game that I'm sitting on the sidelines, my eyes follow you so closely that I sometimes lose track of play. We spend more time together now than I do with my own {b}Vertu{/b}!"
    C "I may not know exactly how or why or when I started feeling this way, but I know that there's a reason you're suddenly showing up in my dreams."
    "It's a surprise even to me how many words come out once I start talking and how intelligible they are — maybe even exactly the words I need to say for once."
    "Tanya watches and listens silently from across the table the whole time, neither judgemental nor sympathetic, just soberly attentive. It makes it that much easier to keep going."
    T "That was really sweet, Clover, and I can tell you thought about it a lot."
    C "I do have a brain despite what you keep implying, and I'll use it for things that are important. Right now, what I am feeling for you is what's important, and I want to know if you feel the same way."
    "Though I don't say it, part of what is making me so serious now is how badly I flubbed my first crush on Sibyl. I learned my lessons then so that I won't make the same mistakes now."
    C "(I'm so sorry, Sibyl, but all the messiness you had to deal with then is going to make things come out better this time I hope.)"
    T "I don't think that I, nor anyone else, could ever remain unmoved when a girl as pretty as you are says such sweet things to her."
    C "Yeah, Vittoria and Vincenza told me that you like blondes, but I want to know if you actually \"like\" {b}me{/b}, Tanya! You wouldn't have tried to kiss me if you didn't, would you?"
    "The terrible thought that maybe I was wrong and that Tanya only wanted to kiss me because she likes my hair absolutely terrifies me."
    T "You really, {b}really{/b} pissed me off when you arrived at the academy, Clover."
    C "(Yes, I know. I still haven't forgotten about all those deaths threats!)"
    C "When I first met you, I thought you were exactly the type of girl to have bullied me in middle school — a nasty, pushy athletic girl who thinks she's so much better than me."
    "With some amusement evident on her face, Tanya recounts that she felt about exactly the same as I did."
    T "And I thought you were a self-righteous blonde girl who thinks she can push me around just because she's prettier than me. There were a few of those at my old school..."
    T "But you've changed so much since I first met you. It happened so slowly that I almost didn't see it happen myself."
    T "There's a lot of dedicated girls on the Wild Roses roster, but none of them can match me the same way you can, and even though we may fight sometimes, I know it will only to make us stronger together."
    C "I-I feel the same way!"
    "It may have started with trying to beat Tanya at her own game as a way of putting her down, but now we're genuinely pushing each other to be a little bit better each and every day."
    T "You're a really cool girl now, Clover, and I want to \"like\" you the same way you think you \"like\" me."
    C "What do you mean you {b}want{/b} to \"like\" me? You tried to {b}kiss{/b} me, didn't you!?"
    "After feeling so light inside hearing Tanya say all those nice things about me, to suddenly hear her clarify that she might only like me and not \"like\" like me feels like a bucket of cold water dumped over my head."
    "I'm nearly jumping out of my seat again, and though I don't raise my voice too loudly, Tanya still does motion for me to calm myself before she continues."
    T "How can you \"like\" me, Clover? You don't even know anything {b}about{/b} me."
    C "I know that—!"
    T "That I like lacrosse? That I'm Chinese?"
    "I want to object to Tanya's reasoning, but I am forced to admit that she's totally correct. Everything that Tanya says sounds reasonable enough to me, though I most certainly do not wish to believe it."
    C "(If we both \"like\" each other, or \"want to like\" at least, then what's the problem?)"
    "There was no doubt in my mind that if we both feel the same way about each other, there'd be nothing at all to stand in the way of whatever comes next."
    C "I-Is this about... Sibyl?"
    T "What about her? I thought you were over her."
    "Tanya's face screws up like I'm asking the stupidest question in the world, with just a little grimace which is no doubt in my mind because she thinks I might be trying to have them {b}both{/b}."
    C "I'm over her! Waaay over! I meant, umm, about you and her."
    T "Clover, you moron, how many times do I have to say it? I was never really serious about being with her in the first place."
    T "Sibyl is straight. I knew that from the beginning and never once had any expectation of changing that, unlike {b}you{/b}."
    T "She's my BFF and I'll do anything for her, but anything romantic that I ever wanted to exist between me and her was over before it ever started."
    C "Okay, good. Sorry, I just had to be sure."
    "All of the impatience which had suddenly flared in Tanya is gone in the next moment, her face returning to an expression more familiar to see upon it."
    T "It's fine, better to get all your stupid questions out now. Do you have any more?"

    C "I'm so excited for my first date!"
    T "Calm down, Clover, we haven't even picked a time or place yet."
    "Tanya lightly chastises me for my agitated excitement, but I can tell by the semi-concealed smile on her face that she is looking forward to it just as much as I am."
    C "Should we ask Vittoria and Vincenza to set something up for us? They'd probably jump at the opportunity."
    T "{b}No!{/b} I mean—"
    T "No, let's not involve anyone else for now. I know they will want us to have our date in the aquarium, and I'd prefer anything but that."

    T "Trust me; I know. Here, this is my number. We can chat about it tonight!"
    C "(Aaah! A girl is giving me her number!)"
    "Even though it's just Tanya, and she's just giving it to me so we can coordinate better, it still feels like a big milestone in my life and a huge boost to my ego to have someone want to pursue me like this."
    "Every day since coming to the academy has been filled with thrilling new \"firsts\", and as I clutch at the scrap of paper Tanya passes off to me, my enthusiasm for the next \"first\" grows with each digit my eyes scan over."
