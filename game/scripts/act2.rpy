    "The next day, I get out of bed without a fuss and follow Sibyl to breakfast."
    "She and Tanya follow their usual routine of exchanging the strawberry and jumping right into whatever crazy thing Sierra did the previous day."
    "I, meanwhile, revel in my double helping of French toast."
    C "(If I stay at this school any longer they're going to have to roll me out.)"
    "I resolve to go with a decidedly lighter calorie yogurt parfait tomorrow, but for today am satisfied that I need the calories after how hard my brain was churning all night."
    T "And then she told me that I had {b}\"perfectly perfunctory perfumery\"{/b}!"
    S "I think... I think that was an insult."
    T "When it comes to Sierra, who even knows?"
    "Sibyl's laughter at Tanya's expressive storytelling rings sweetly in my ears, no doubt sounding very much like a veritable chorus of angels if they were to be placed beside my goofy guffaws."
    C "(Is there {b}anything{/b} wrong with her?)"
    "A cube of cantaloupe speared on a fork slips through her lips while she listens to her friend."
    "A shiver trembles my shoulders at the exact same moment that I think I could do the same tomorrow with the strawberry atop my yogurt parfait, just like Tanya does every day."
    C "(I like strawberries too, but maybe Sibyl likes they way more than me?)"
    "Thoughts like these are new as of yesterday. After calming down considerably from the emotional highs of the care package, I finally called my parents."
    "I felt a considerable amount of anxiety when to do it; it felt like Abraxas was sitting on my chest as I dialed the numbers."
    "But when the phone connected and I heard my parents' voices again, the rush of anger that I had expected never materialized."
    "We spoke about a lot of things. Most of all they wanted to hear about my new school and friends, which I realized I know embarrassingly little to speak about."
    "I couldn't bear to tell my parents I had {b}no{/b} friends whatsoever, but I did tell them about my roommate."
    C "(If there's anyone who might fit the bill, it's the girl who turn on me even after being so mean to her.)"
    "Sibyl hasn't treated me any differently, but I'd still like to apologize. I just can't figure out how to make \"sorry for being such a bitch\" sound better."
    "Most important of all, I promised my parents that I'd have more to tell them about next time they called, so I have good reason to be watching Sibyl so closely."
    S "Clover?"
    C "A-Hunh?"
    "Lost in my thoughts while observing fruit disappear between her lips, I don't even realize when Sibyl addresses me directly. Tanya, it seems, has gone off somewhere, leaving the two of us alone."
    S "Are you feeling well? You've been kinda... lost in space, all morning."
    C "I'm... I'm good."
    "Shaking off the daze from the depth of my thoughts, an awkwardness seems in to replace it."
    S "Mmm. Glad to hear it."
    "Sibyl must be feeling it too. I can tell she's restraining herself around me despite being such a chatterbox with Tanya. It's actually making me feel a little jealous for some reason."
    C "Sibyl, umm... what did you do?"
    S "Excuse me...?"
    C "(Words, Clover, use your words!)"
    "As usual, my intense rate of mental processing is making my thoughts churn through faster than my mouth can voice them."
    C "Before I came here. When you weren't with Tanya, how did you spend your time outside of class?"
    S "You... want to know about me?"
    "She says the words like a question, but by the looks of her face it's more of a surprised yet joyful statement."
    S "How wonderful! And after only a week!"
    "I can already feel a flush spread across my face but push through it for the sake of learning more about the one and only person I might potentially call a friend."
    S "I'm so glad you're feeling better, Clover. You {b}are{/b} feeling better, right?"
    C "I-I think so...? Let's say \"yes\" for now."
    "The anger might be gone but there's still a confusing vortex of different emotions swirling inside of me which I have yet to place."
    C "But anyway, I'd like to know more. About you. Which is why I asked."
    S "I see! Well, whenever I was alone I would most often either work on a project in the art room or find a new book in the library."
    S "Have you visited the library yet, Clover? It's {b}wondrous{/b}. The light streams through the windows is such a picturesque way and the smell is just perfect."
    C "(The smell? Of the library? Is that a normal thing to appreciate?)"
    C "Just once but I was kind of out of it at the time."
    S "Oh? Then you {b}must{/b} come with me tomorrow evening? I've been meaning to pick up a new novel anyway."
    C "O-Oh, yeah? I didn't know you were so into reading, Sibyl."
    S "There's a lot of things you don't know about me Clover!"
    "I distinctly feel as though we've had this conversation before, but this time Sibyl is much more happy to be saying the same thing."
    T "They were out of blueberry so I got us lemon poppy seed. Is that alright, Sibyl?"
    "Tanya returns out of nowhere and drops a tasty-looking muffin in front of Sibyl and her own seat at the table."
    S "Lemon poppy seed is just as delicious. Thank you."
    C "(So, wait, Tanya dislikes strawberries for having seeds on the outside, but is okay with muffins freckled with seeds?)"
    S "Tanya, I am going to show Clover the library tomorrow. Would you like to come with us?"
    "Sibyl's best friend unexpectedly turns down the offer, which is a surprise to me until she gives me a dirty look the second Sibyl turns away."
    C "(I'm not trying to {b}steal{/b} your best friend.)"
    "I say the words in my head but they obviously don't transmit into Tanya's mind through the air."
    S "Oh, that's right, you are usually busy on Saturday evening. Maybe another time then; I'd like to find an activity the three of us can do together."
    "I don't even know whether she's intentionally guilt tripping us, but both Tanya and I simultaneously fail to meet Sibyl's gaze."
    "Despite what I thought just before, some part of me actually is quite glad that Tanya won't be showing her face at the library later."

    "My cheeks burn red, but no one around seems to have noticed a thing. Sibyl merely smiles back as she offers out a lacrosse stick for me to grab."
    S "Have you played lacrosse before, Clover?"
    C "Nope. But we had a girls' team at my old school."
    "I start with the intention of passing the ball from the netting at the end of my stick by planting my feet and whipping the head forward, but nothing happens."
    "The ball remains stubbornly in my net despite how much I shake it out in frustration, ultimately ending up with smacking myself over the head with my own stick."
    "Sibyl barely holds back a giggle at my expense."
    C "Ow. Okay, yeah, I have no idea what I'm doing. Help me, Sibyl."
    "Sibyl instructs me on where to properly place my hands upon the {i}crosse{/i} stick, how to take the correct stance, and finally the correct motion to make the pass successfully."
    "In no time at all we're passing the ball back and forth like I didn't just pick up this crosse for the first time in my life."
    C "(This is actually... kind of fun!)"
    S "You're a natural, Clover!"
    C "Hehe, thanks!"
    "It feels so strangely good to move in time with Sibyl as we volley to each other that I cannot help but allow my lps to spread into a broad grin."
    S "You should think about joining the academy's team! They're always looking for more girls."
    C "The lacrosse team? Are you on it too?"
    "I know it's a silly question the moment I speak it aloud as I am well aware that Sibyl is part of the art club instead. The playful mood of the moment must have made me dumb."
    S "No, but some of the girls on the team split their time with the art club on days the lacrosse team has no training."
    "I cannot deny that it feels pretty good but I don't know how I'd compare against actual players, and without the major confidence boost from Sibyl's encouragement ether."

    S "It's really too bad about her personality though."
    "As supernaturally pretty as Sierra might be, she doesn't capture my attention nearly as much as Sibyl, to whom I find my gaze drawn back toward."

    S "Of course I want to tell you about myself. I've only been waiting for you to want to know about me."
    "As we stand there in the hallway, her hand around mind, I recall to mind the image of Anne and Diana standing with hands clasped, gazing at each other bashfully amongst the tiger lilies."
    "The moment ends just as quickly as it comes. Once the girls pass us, Sibyl releases my hand but remains where she is."
    S "Clover, I'm an orphan too, just like Anne."
    C "Y-You are!?"
    S "I am indeed. Did you expect me to have it branded on my forehead?"
    C "Ah, no, sorry, I'm just being stupid I guess. I'm going to stop talking now."
    "I can barely stand to look at Sibyl with how stupid and probably rude I was being, but she continues on unoffended and instead rather amused."
    S "I was always at the library as a girl â€” anything to get out of the crowded foster home â€” so when I discovered Anne, I empathized with her right away."
    S "So taken by her was I that I took on her personality as well. I let my imagination run wild and began talking non-stop."
    "A rare bashful flush comes across Sibyl's cheeks as she speaks, which suits her graceful features wonderfully so I think."
    S "I probably made life hell for all my foster brothers and sisters, to be honest."
    S "Eventually I grew out of acting so childishly, but the little Anne in me remains whenever I put brush to canvas and let my imagination run wild."
    S "Even know I'm still dreaming about my own Green Gables."
    "Sibyl's attention turns presently back to me from out of her own memories, making me flinch back against her cheerful countenance."
    "After all the terrible things I said about my very much alive parents in front of her, I feel only shame her face."
    C "(No matter how difficult things may have gotten at home, my parents are still alive and care for me deeply.)"
    "It's strange how foolish the me of a week past was to deny the warmth in my chest I feel when I think of them now."
    C "(And that warmth is something Sibyl will never have.)"
    S "You might say that every day since my scholarship was awarded has been just another chapter in {i}Sibyl of Prudence Prep{/i}."
    C "Wow, Sibyl, I had no idea..."
    S "How could you, with your own problems at the forefront of your mind?"
    C "Sibyl, I'm so sorry for being such a terrible person, Iâ€”"
    "Sibyl reaches for my hand again, instantly shutting me up and making my heart feel like it's going to burst straight out of my chest like the alien from that movie."
    S "Stop, Clover, it's in the past now."
    "I stop, just as ordered, and swallow the lump in my throat while I do. Sibyl smiles sweetly and resumes us walking again after the moment passes."
    C "So if you're Anne, who is Diana?"
    C "(Oh my God, stop just asking whatever is on your mind, idiot!)"
    "For some reason, the question burns inside me such that I cannot stop it from jumping out as it does."
    S "I had hoped that it would be my Vertu partner."
    "Warmth swells in my chest from some source unknown, only to be harshly doused by her next reply."
    S "...Until she never came. Then I met Tanya."
    "I know Tanya probably hates me, and I'm not particularly fond of her either, but hearing Sibyl name Tanya as her \"bosom friend\" really sinks me into the depths emotionally."
    C "S-So it's Tanya?"
    S "Oh, but you're here now too, and I don't think Anne would ever say you can't have {b}two{/b} \"bosom friends\", would she?"
    "It's a complicated feeling, that which settles into the pit of my stomach, caught somewhere between hope and despair."
    "But what unsettles me most of all is that someone I've only known for a week should do these things to my heart."

    S "Well I think that sounds lovely, Tanya."
    "Tanya follows Miss Izzie to the storage room where the art supplies are kept, and the twins follow them for some reason which I am definitely not complaining about."

    S "Ah! Here it is!"
    "Sibyl slides one of the canvases out of the crate to hold up for me to view, beaming all the way."
    S "What do you think?"
    "It's pretty clearly a painting of the school grounds in autumn. I recognize it even without snow on the ground and with leaves of many colors in the trees."
    "Each stroke of the brush is clearly visible with thick globs of paint remaining smeared across the canvas, giving it a distinctly smudged look I've seen from other famous paintings."
    C "This is the main pathway up to the academy, right? It looks nice."
    "I've never been much of an art critic, but it does look neat, and I have a sneaking suspicion that Sibyl painted this one herself with how proudly she's smiling at me."
    S "Thank you! I'm doing a whole study of this particular scene, one for each season."
    S "This is autumn, obviously. See how I used a heavy impressionist stroke with the oil paints to portray the colors in the trees?"
    "Sibyl cranes her head around the canvas and reaches a finger to point out a tree, where she uses only a few blotches of different shades of orange, yellow, and red to portray a multitude of hues."
    "I don't really get it, but I can feel the joyous energy radiating off Sibyl as she shows me her work, and that's enough for me."
    S "I did the Summer in acrylics and am currently working through Winter with watercolors. It's so hard to get {b}just{/b} the right hues of off-white for the snow, but I like the challenge."
    S "And I'm thinking about doing Spring with spray paint!"
    C "Spray paint? Like on a wall?"
    S "No, silly, on canvas, with stencils!"
    S "What you do is analyze the subject and break it down into a ton of tiny little parts, cut out those shapes from paper, then spray over it to leave only that shape."
    S "It requires a very good eye for composition since everything has to be broken into smaller shapes rather than created a whole, but I think I can do it."
    C "If there's anyone who can do it, it would be you, Sibyl. My brain is already melting just trying to follow what you're saying."
    S "It's easy enough to get started, and fun too! You should try it in art class, Clover."
    C "Maybe..."
    "Spray paint is one thing I actually do have experience with, but when I think about that phase where I would spray paint dark and edgy \"arcane\" symbols on trees at the park, I can only cringe."
    C "(And then when I heard the police started investigating them, I ditched the spray paint in the trash and cowered in my room. Ugh, I'm so stupid.)"
    "Desperately do I need to stop returning to the dark, dark days of middle school, so I try to turn things back around to Sibyl instead."
    C "How did you get started with art, Sibyl?"
    "While I was off in my own world, Sibyl seems to have returned her canvas to the stack and begun searching through them again. When I ask her the question, she pauses to answer."
    S "Oh, well, I told you about how I went through that embarrassing phase of acting like Anne Shirley, right?"
    "A soft flush comes to Sibyl's cheeks, which I find incredibly adorable to witness."
    C "(I'm so glad I'm not the only one here embarrassed by her past, but mine is definitely {b}way{/b} more mortifying.)"
    S "My foster parents sat me down with a bunch of art supplies as a way to channel my outpouring of imagination into a more constructive outlet."
    S "And, well, I just think everyone was tired of hearing me chattering about nonsense too."
    C "That's... kind of cute."
    S "You think so?"

    S "If we were melting directly against the heat the stirring process would be important so that the chocolate doesn't burn, but with this method it's mostly to help it melt evenly."
    "Well, if what she needs from me is to stir the chocolate, stir the chocolate I can do."
    "While I stand in front of the pot spinning a little spatula around the dark chocolate wafers, Sibyl does the same with the white chocolate wafers."
    "I watch her as she works setting up a duplicate melting bowl for the white wafers. A broad grin is plastered across her face just like the type she wears while concentrating on her art."

    "I reach for the handle to pick up the bowl but Sibyl quickly stops me right there."
    S "How about I do this first one and get you set up?"
    "Contrary to what I was thinking, the right way to fill the little half sphere molds Sibyl picked out is {b}not{/b} to pick up the bowl and pour molten chocolate over the edge."
    "Instead, Sibyl gets a roll of parchment paper, cuts off a piece, and forms cone she calls a \"piping bag\". She cuts the tip off then scoops some of the chocolate in the big end."
    C "Wow, you're like an expert at this..."
    "Neatly she controls the flow out of the narrow tip, expertly filling in the little cavities of the mold without any spillage."

    C "Uhh, sure."
    "I am far less adept with the piping bag than Sibyl, but as she stirs her own chocolate and supervises my work she assures me it all comes with practice."
    "When they're all all filled in, I store the mold in the refrigerator to chill and solidify the chocolates, then return to find Sibyl placing her white chocolate into another piping bag."
    C "So are you going to tell me what this is all about yet?"
    S "You'll see, in due time!"
    "While we wait for the chocolates to solidify in the refrigerator, Sibyl takes her white chocolate piping bag to the milk chocolate wafers and adds spaced out tiny dots of white around the edges."
    "I still don't really get it but enjoy watching Sibyl go about her business adding the small dots around the discs with careful, precise movements."
    C "(It's so cute the way her tongue just barely sticks out while she's concentrating so hard on making those little touches to a small of an object!)"
    "Once finished, Sibyl places a pan onto the heat of the stove and send me off to fetch the hardened chocolate hemispheres."
    C "What's the pan for?"
    "Of everything that she has done so far, this new development is what confuses me the most about Sibyl's plans."

    O "It's a good match."
    "A shiver trembles across my body as the image of Tanya's face explodes into my mind. Visions of her in increasingly intimate situations with myself come unbidden and make me sick to my stomach."
    C "Blegh. I'd rather die."
    H "Heavens! What a dreadful thing to say about your dearest companion!"
    "While Vittoria continues to tease and flirt with me in the most infuriating fashion, Vincenza remains silent until I inadvertently give myself away yet again."
    C "Tanya is {b}not{/b} my \"dearest companion\". She's barely even a friend. The only person I care about is {b}Sibyl{/b}."
    O "Aha! So the kind-hearted Sibyl who stood by your in your darkest days is the one to have tied up your heartstrings into knots."
    H "Oh, I can picture it now. The innocent young Clover, red-faced and bashful listening to her crush sleep unguarded in the next bed over."
    H "Desperately she wishes to climb betwixt and press their bodes close, to feel her warmth and share her own. She longs for the caress of her naked bodyâ€”"
    C "{b}Eww{/b}, stop fantasizing about me and Sibyl. Also, \"betwixt\"?"
    O "Longingly she admires Sibyl's graceful features set against the light shining through the large glass panes of the classroom windows."
    O "In a secret page of her notebook she writes fragments of love poems she will never send while the teacher drones on at the front of the classroom."
    O "The margins of her note are filled with every detail of her crush's life, from what she ate for breakfast to a jealous list of everyone with whom she's spoken each day."
    C "I'm not a creep!"
    H "...Sneaking glances over the top of her textbook while Sibyl changes out of her uniform, her hand finds itself between her legs. A stifled moan dies in her throat as the firm top of her pencil brushesâ€”"
    C "Seriously, stop!"
    "I feel a little guilty about how accurate the first part of what she says turns out to be, but wouldn't dare give away that much after everything I've already revealed."
    O "Behind Sibyl she follows like an obedient puppy, love-struck by her first crush. A sweet haze of longing clouds about her mind. She carries the heavy weight of passion for her doomed love."
    C "Would you {b}cut it out{/b}!?"
    "My sudden outburst draws both of the twins out of their fantasies. I am relieved both they finally stop and that we have been in this deserted hallway the entire time."
    "Just hearing these two prattle on at my expense has helped me confirm that, yes, I for sure have feelings for Sibyl. They both romantic {b}and{/b} sexual, as Vincenza and Vittoria detail respectively."
    C "And don't just {b}decide{/b} my love is doomed for yourself!"
    H "Clover, darling..."
    O "She's your first love. There will be others."
    "Vittoria droops her head to one side to accentuate the look of absolute pity she offers me while Vincenza at least tries to console me."
    C "(Console me from {b}what{/b}?)"
    C "I don't need any \"others\", least of all {b}you{/b}, so stop trying."
    "The twins once again turn to speak to each other as if I am not present at all, and being kept backed into a corner between the two of them."
    H "She doesn't know, Vincenza. Do we crush her heart now or let her it wither by itself?"
    O "It would be a mercy, Vittoria, to let her down easily while we still can."
    C "Oh, just spit it out already."
    "The twins strike soft-hearted poses matching their unique personas, Vittoria with her a hand gently resting upon her cheek and Vincenza with her arms crossed at her chest."
    O "Clover, your tale ends only in tragedy."
    H "You're not the first to try to pluck that stubborn flower."
    C "What do you mean?"
    "The words tumble out of my lips in a tone tinged with desperation. I wouldn't normally put any stock in what the twins say whatsoever, but something inside of me knows they are not joking this time."
    O "Sibyl is {b}straight{/b}, Clover."
    "The simple sentence drives a stake right through my heart."
    C "No..."
    "I've heard those words before, but only now that I've come to terms with my own feelings do I fully realize what they mean to me."
    H "Frighteningly so, I'm afraid. She rejected even Vincenza and I without the slightest hesitation."
    "Vittoria's casual tone does nothing to soothe the flash of hot anger that flares up inside me at the thought that these two perverts had tried to put their moves on {b}my{/b} Sibyl."
    "But the growing angst inside of me smothers the ember before it can light any larger fires."
    O "Maybe if you had a pair of guardian angels sitting on your shoulder..."
    "Vincenza's tentative musing draws me out of my growing stupor to find the twins sharing another inaudible conversation with a meeting of their eyes."
    "A broad smile stretches maliciously across Vittoria's face, and the pair close in around me, speaking low and quietly almost in my ears."
    H "...Two girls uniquely positioned to make girls' loves flourish..."
    O "...Maybe Sibyl could be cured of her heterosexuality."
    C "No!"
    "I push out between Vittoria and Vincenza before me, squeaking through the gap I open between them."
    C "No, no, no, no. You're not angels, you're {b}devils{/b}."
    C "I don't need your help. I don't {b}want{/b} your help. I'm going to get through to Sibyl no matter what Tanya says, or what {b}you{/b} say!"
