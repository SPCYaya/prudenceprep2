    "The excitement of homecoming swiftly fades into the doldrums of passing the week-long Easter break when most students have left for home."
    S "Tanya! Gimme your threes!"
    T "Go fish."
    S "Aww..."
    "Sibyl surprised me on Sunday by attending services in the academy's chapel."
    "She told me after that she isn't religious, but that the foster family she has been with for the past few years used to take her and her foster sibling every Christmas and Easter."
    C "(She probably just went because there's nothing {b}else{/b} to do with everyone else away.)"
    "All student activities are on hold, both classes and extra-curriculars. Even the cafeteria is operating with a depressingly limited menu."
    "Sibyl and Tanya both also have chosen to stay behind, leaving the three of us to scrape the bottom of the barrel of activities to entertain us."
    T "I'll take your tens, Sibyl."
    S "Here you go!"
    "I've always gotten the impression that Sibyl genuinely likes her foster family, so why she hasn't chosen to return home is a bit of a mystery to me."
    "As the game drags on well into the afternoon, I try to think up ways I can subtly ask her about it in a manner that won't sound like I'm prying into her personal business."
    S "Clover, it's your turn."
    C "Huh? Oh, umm, Sibyl, have any nines?"
    S "Tanya {b}just{/b} took them from me. Are you feeling alright, Clover?"
    "Realizing that I must be zoning out further than I think I am, I confess to being bored with Go Fish and propose just ending the game altogether."
    "The other two accept so quickly that I almost feel like they must have been thinking of ending the game too. All three of us flop down on the bed with exaggerated malaise."
    T "I'm so glad you're staying for Easter break, Sibyl. Are you sure your foster family won't mind?"
    "After thinking how best to ask such a personal question to Sibyl, Tanya suddenly outright asks the very same thing I was wondering."
    S "It's only a week, and after seeing how stir-crazy you were after our Christmas break I couldn't do that to you again."
    "It's clear from Tanya's expression that she doesn't like this answer, and Sibyl is quick to alleviate her concerns posthaste."
    S "Really, I wanted to stay! The whole reason I applied for this scholarship is to experience all the ups and downs of living out on my own."
    T "Okay, but why is Clover still here? I thought she was finally getting along with her parents again?"
    "That Tanya asks Sibyl instead of me gets on my nerves, so despite how I don't really care to share my personal life with her, now I feel obligated."
    C "I also {b}chose{/b} to stay here this week, Tanya."
    "I've told Sibyl all about what happened with my parents' divorce, but given Tanya's dated knowledge of my situation I assume that my roommate hasn't been talking behind my back."
    "Tanya must have realized {b}something{/b} was wrong when I suddenly fell apart right before the tryouts, but she usually has enough tact not to shove her face where it doesn't belong."
    C "For your information, my parents' divorce was finalized a few weeks ago. I've accepted that it happened but that doesn't mean I'm prepared to go back to whatever will be \"home\" from now on."
    T "That sounds like you're avoiding your parents to me."
    C "Well I didn't {b}ask{/b} your opinion, did I? Why are {b}you{/b} still here?"
    T "Did you really expect me to fly all the way to Singapore and back again over a one week break?"
    C "Singa-{b}what{/b}? I thought you were Chinese?"
    T "I {b}am{/b} Chinese, but my parents and siblings all live in Singapore."
    T "We used to go back and forth living between here and there when I was little. Ever since my older brother's wife had their baby, however, everyone else in my family has remained there."
    C "Why?"
    T "Look, Clover, family as a concept is entirely different in Asia than it is here. It's better for everyone that I stay in America."
    "It's obvious that the topic is more than a little touchy for Tanya so i drop it altogether. There's no sense in aggravating Tanya, especially when Sibyl is around to tell us off."

    "After lunch we head to the library as our next means of passing the time away."
    "Sibyl gets lost in her {i}Girls' Mix{/i} back issues while I opt to flip casually through an {i}Archaeology Insights{/i} article issue about the Sumerian priestess Enheduanna."
    C "(She really liked this \"Inanna\" person, huh?)"
    "A flutter in my peripheral vision from across the table draws my attention away. It's Tanya holding her {i}Sports Annotated{/i} issue open longways from top to bottom."
    C "What are you doing to that magazine?"
    T "Nothing!"
    "Tanya quickly stammers and turns it the right way to flip to the next page, which only makes her actions all the more suspicious."
    C "Gimme that."
    T "Hey!"
    "I snatch the magazine from her hands. The cover features some woman in a bathing suit at the beach."
    C "(Maybe there's an article about surfing?)"
    "I flip through all the pages to find whatever might cause Tanya to hold it so awkwardly, and find the center pages of the magazine fit the orientation."
    C "Hmm..."
    "I first cant my head sideways, then turn the hole magazine around like Tanya did before."
    C "(I wonder if she likes blondes?)"
    "It's no surfing article but a head to toe photograph of a blonde-haired model in a bikini that made Tanya flip the whole magazine around."
    C "(No, I don't think this is surfing related at all. Or any sport for that matter.)"
    "The model is pretty, sure, but way too made up for the photoshoot in my opinion."
    S "What's up? Is there a good article in that issue?"
    C "Uh, just some new lacrosse stick models. You probably wouldn't be interested, Sibyl."
    "I quickly toss the magazine back at Tanya and earn a quiet glare, though she predictably catches it before impact."
    C "Speaking of lacrosse, when are the practices starting up again?"
    T "The first Tuesday after everyone returns from Easter break."
    S "I'm so glad that you're going to continue playing lacrosse, Clover. I just {b}know{/b} you're going to do great!"
    C "That's the plan! I can't let Tanya hog all the glory in the midfield."
    T "Maybe if you didn't gorge yourself on French toast every morning you could keep up!"
    C "I {b}told{/b} you that I need that sugar energy!"
    T "You really don't."
    C "Maybe {b}you{/b} don't!"
    S "Let's go find a book about sports nutrition, Clover! There's sure to be one around here somewhere."
    "I know that Sibyl is only trying to cut off a bigger conflict between me and Tanya before it starts but I don't hesitate to take her up on the offer."
    "Unfortunately, when we do find the book and pore through the impressively dense text, Tanya doesn't hesitate to gloat about her being right in the end."
    "Tanya thinks she has all the answers about keeping up with her athletics, and admittedly, the results are impressive. That leaves me with only one choice."

    T "What are you {b}doing{/b} here, Clover?"
    "Against my better judgement, I manage to drag myself out of the sweet caress of sleep early the next morning to ambush Tanya before she goes out on her daily run."
    C "Training. Since you have {b}all{/b} the answers, I'm gong to do everything you do."
    T "What? No!"
    C "Are you afraid that I'm going to get better than you?"
    T "{b}No{/b}, that's not going to happen. I just don't want you bothering me while I'm in the zone."
    C "Then you'd better start taking laps in your room if you don't want me around. Besides, won't the {b}team{/b} play better if {b}I{/b} play better?"
    "I make a big show of warming up to run, which coupled with my flawless arguments immediately changes Tanya's tine without any more need for discussion."
    T "Fine. It's a big field and there's plenty of room for both of us. Besides, you won't be able to keep up with me anyway."
    C "Oh yeah? We'll see about that!"
    "When Tanya starts off, I kick it into high gear to keep up to pace with her. Though she has no music in her ears or anything, she remains focused straight ahead without ever getting distracted."
    C "(Is she counting steps in her head? How does she stay so {b}focused{/b}?)"
    "I fight on valiantly, but by the time I'm huffing and puffing with each step, Tanya's still as cool and composed as when she started."
    "Tanya cleanly finishes her desired number of laps and proceeds off the field to walk a small loop in place as she checks her pulse."
    C "(Seriously, what is {b}with{/b} her!?)"
    "I make well sure to finish the exact same amount of circuits as Tanya did, just so she can't hold that over my head too."
    "With the last circuit finished, I stagger on shaky legs over to where Tanya rests and flop unceremoniously on my back into the cool grass."
    T "Your warm up was adequate but you need to {b}cool down{/b} after running too. If you don't, your muscles will tighten up and become sore."
    C "Shut up, Tanya!"
    "Despite my nearly-breathless exclamation at Tanya, I manage to scrape myself off the ground and walk a few circles around my running partner before flopping back into the grass."
    T "Here, hydrate."
    C "{b}Urk!{/b}"
    "Tanya responds to my jibe by dropping my water bottle right on top of my stomach, resulting in the rather unpleasant sounding exclamation as it impacts, but no lasting damage."

    S "I'm so proud of you, Clover!"
    "Sibyl's praise is even sweeter than the maple syrup-drizzled yogurt parfait that I struggle to shovel into my mouth with the last of my remaining energy."
    T "Today was the fastest time ever."
    S "That's great! Just last week you were telling me that you thought your times were stuck in a rut."
    "Neither of us want to admit it for our own selfish reasons, but we both know the only reason Tanya was able to break her record is because I was there to challenge her."
    "After lunch, I fall into a deep food coma and nap so long that I almost miss lunch time were it not for a timely intervention by Sibyl and Tanya."

    "I bravely flop out of bed at the crack of dawn the next morning too. Tanya is already waiting for me at the lacrosse field when I arrive."
    T "Good, you're here. I was beginning to think I broke you after pushing too hard yesterday. Warm up and grab a stick."
    "Some manner of grumbling quivers my vocal cords but produces only an unintelligible retort to Tanya's upbeat denigration."
    "The cool morning air and the reinvigorated coursing of blood through my body as a result of my warm-ups eventually returns proper English words to my speech."
    C "What are the lacrosse sticks for? Aren't we going to run laps again?"
    T "I wanted to try something a little more tough now that I have a partner. Think you can keep up with me?"
    C "Quit looking down on me, Tanya. You're no better at anything than I am; you just have a head start on training!"
    "Rather than do simple laps around the field, we both grab a stick and run in parallel up and down the length of the field, tossing and catching the ball to one another as we go."
    C "(I'm not going to let Tanya brag off to Sibyl today! This is the day that I hold my own until {b}Tanya{/b} is the one sobbing into her granola!)"
    "My desired victory ultimately fails to come to fruition, but despite the workout being doubly as intense as the day before, I manage to hold my own all the way until we call it quits."
    C "(This counts as a victory for me, right?)"
    "The twins are waiting on the sidelines to ambush us when we finally finish our jog and pass laps. As we greedily gulp down the contents of our water bottles, the President and Vice President silently circle us in opposite directions."
    "With Tanya clearly just ignoring them, I am forced the be the one who has to speak up to this strange behavior."
    C "Umm... What's happening here?"
    O "We are observing the competition."
    C "Competition?"
    T "Honestly, Clover. If you don't want to play their games, just ignore them."
    "Having been first to strike out at whatever game the twins might be playing, they take the opportunity to pounce around either side of her."
    "Vincenza stops right in front to tug softly at her necktie like something might happen if she does, while her sister Vittoria slides around back to daintily lift the back of her skort - only to realize with a pout that it is indeed a skort."
    T "What are you even doing here? Shoo, shoo."
    "As before, all it takes for Tanya to remove the twins' unwanted incursion is for her to tell them off, though she does reserve a soft flick to the forehead for Vittoria, who probably deserves it."
    O "The Easter break is almost over."
    H "Our flight was moved up at the last moment."
    "I've noticed it too — how many more girls are populating the cafeteria in the past day."
    C "Is this about the whole Homecoming thing? I'm definitely {b}not{/b} entering next you so you have nothing to worry about."
    O "Homecoming?"
    H "Oh, no no no."
    O "We mean, of course, the Student Council."

    T "You're both {b}way{/b} off base, as usual. I don't even {b}like{/b} Clover, let alone want to be her girlfriend."
    "Somehow, Tanya's words actually hurt me a little after all that hard training we just completed together. I feel that I must have earned at least {b}some{/b} of her respect, but apparently not."
    C "Y-Yeah, Tanya is the worst. I hate her."
    "I end up throwing what Tanya said about me back at the twins, but really it's more directed at Tanya who started it in the first place."
    H "{b}Tsun—{/b}"
    O "{b}—Dere.{/b}"
    "The twins stare down Tanya directly as they emphasize the first part of their accusatory-sounding words, then turn the spotlight on me for the second half."
    C "H-Hey, don't start speaking Italian!"
    T "You're {b}wrong{/b}!"
    "Tanya whips the equipment bag over her shoulder and storms off without another word, or even waiting for me to follow her back to return the crosse still in my hands."
    C "What was all that about?"
    O "We may have teased her a little too strongly."
    H "Tanya has something of a \"love-hate relationship\" with blondes."
    O "Worry not. We will apologize later."
    C "Let me first make one thing clear; I'm {b}not{/b} worried about Tanya."
    C "What does she have against blondes anyway?"
    O "Has she ever told you about her Vertu partner, Sierra?"
    C "Her Vertu? The girl who is apparently the human incarnation of everything bad in the world according to Tanya?"
    O "Yes, {b}that{/b} Sierra."
    "It is true that Sierra has blonde hair similar to mine, except that my large sample of secondhand knowledge about her indicates that she's way worse of a person than me even on my worst days."
    H "I believe the phrase Tanya used was \"hate-fuck\"."
    C "Like, she hates her, but wants to... you know?"
    H "Well, Sierra {b}is{/b} gorgeous, right?"
    "Rather than ask the question of me, Vittoria looks toward her sister, who nods her agreement."
    C "(It almost seems like they're implying they'd sleep with anyone who is super pretty, but that can't be true because they slept me someone like me.)"
    "A shiver unrelated to the cool early Spring air washes over me, and I try to push what happened that day completely out of my mind again."
    C "Well I'm {b}not{/b} Sierra, so if that's what's behind the {b}problem{/b} Tanya has with me, she can leave the attitude back in her dorm room."
    H "Maybe that enough gossipping for today. We did not come here {b}just{/b} to tease you both."
    O "No, we also wanted to check on you, Clover. You looked exceptionally pale at the homecoming ceremony."
    C "(So I'm just supposed to be okay with the teasing because you ask me how I'm doing after?)"
    C "Don't be concerned about me. I'm fine — never better in fact."
    "The twins before me are very obviously not satisfied with my answer given the way they look toward one another, so in the interest of getting them off my back I throw them a few scraps to nibble on."
    C "I'm not very good with being in the spotlight so Sibyl kinda coerced me and Tanya to go to the dance together and use the homecoming competition as a way for me to face those fears."
    "Rather than express any interest whatsoever in what is an admission of a deeply held fear of mine, Vittoria and Vincenza are somehow more interested in Sibyl's role in the whole affair."
    O "So it was not Tanya who asked you to the dance..."
    H "...But rather our pigtailed mutual friend who orchestrated the whole thing?"
    C "Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
    "Vittoria and Vincenza once more turn quiet to stare deeply into one another's eyes for a solid minute and a half."
    C "(This can't be good.)"
    C "I'm... going to go now. Bye."
    "The trance which came over the twins breaks just as quickly as it started when I announce my departure. Each displays a wide grin which somehow sets me ill at ease despite offering pleasant parting wishes alongside it."

    "Tanya is already seated when I arrive at breakfast after practice. When I sit down with my own yogurt parfait adjacent from her, she mostly just ignores my presence altogether."
    "Yes, nothing at all is amiss, except that Sibyl has yet to arrive. It is quite unlike her to be late; in fact, she hasn't {b}ever{/b} beaten Tanya to the cafeteria in the whole time I've been at the academy."
    T "Did Sibyl's hair get tangled in her sleep again?"
    C "What?"
    T "The last time Sibyl missed breakfast it was because her hair was a disaster zone that she was struggling to rebuild."
    T "She wouldn't even leave her room until she felt presentable again. It took us {b}hours{/b} to unravel it all."
    "It doesn't at all come as a surprise to find out that Tanya is worrying about Sibyl in the same way I am, but I really wish she didn't have to flaunt how muh more she knows about my Vertu than I do."
    C "I don't know. I showered in the locker room."
    "I try not to look like I'm worried about what happened to Sibyl, and so too does Tanya despite both of us stealthily glancing toward the doorway every so often."
    "When Sibyl finally does show, it's with two girls on either side of her who aren't {b}us{/b} for once."
    "Vittoria and Vincenza flank her on either side, each linking an arm into hers from each flank. Sibyl apparently thinkings it is the most amusing thing ever by how brightly she's smiling."
    "The trio parts gaily at the entryway, the twins splitting off toward the kitchens together and Sibyl stepping toward our usual table in the cafeteria."
    "The pair of me and Tanya glaring her direction must be a sight to behold because her cheerful smile breaks into a surprised start when she spots us shooting daggers between her and the twins from across the room."
    S "Good mornin'! Sorry I'm late; I had an audience with the local royalty this morning."
    C "We saw."
    T "What did they want?"
    "Both of us can scarcely conceal our suspicions behind a neutral tone, but that doesn't stop Sibyl from remaining as cheerful as before."
    S "Book recommendations!"
    "It's not just me and Tanya behaving shifty. Sibyl's answer, despite being delivered in a fast and upbeat fashion, is accompanied by a roll of her away away from either of us."
    C "What did you recommend?"
    S "Anne of Green Gables, of course!"
    T "The library has only one copy, and you recommended it to both of them?"
    S "They do everything else together, so why not read together?"
    "Even with both of us trying to subtly interrogate her, Sibyl gives up nothing at all and quickly switches gears toward our plans for the rest of the day."
    C "What makes it a \"break\" if the teachers assign homework over it?"
    S "No whining, Clover! You have to keep your grades up if you want to stay on the lacrosse team."
    T "What she said."
    S "See? Tanya agrees. That's why she's going to come help you finish it up too."
    T "I didn't say {b}that{/b}! I already finished {b}my{/b} homework three days ago!"
    S "Perfect! That means you'll be well equipped to help Clover with any problems she has working through it!"
    C "But you already finished it too, and you're my Vertu partner!"
    S "Oh, I'll be there alright, but it's you two who need some off-the-field bonding!"
    C "Wasn't homecoming torture enough!?"
