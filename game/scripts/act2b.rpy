    "After warmups, the team splits into groups to play shifts of {i}sixes{/i}, a type of lacrosse where two teams of five \"runners\" — who play both offense and defense — and a goaltender face off in a fast-paced, non-stop lacrosse match."

    "By moving the crosse in a semi-circular motion to produce centrifugal forces, the ball can be kept securely in the \"pocket\" at the top of the stick even at an elevated position."
    "It's an essential skill which has been something of an issue for me in past practices, so starting today it's one of my highest priorities to get right."

    "Vittoria manages to find a way out of playing an instrument she clearly has never touched in her life just in time for Sibyl to push her way through the crowd to meet Tanya and I somewhere far away from curious fans."

    T @ contemplative talk alt2 "I knew I made some fans today after my performance in the game, but not enough to beat Vittoria and Vincenza in an all-out popularity contest."
    "The weight of the tiara atop my head confirms that, yes, everything that just happened was real."
    C @ anxious "(This is all too realistic to be one of my crazy vivid dreams.)"
    S @ smile talk "Not just that, but Clover was able to hold her own out there on the stage all by herself!"
    T @ frown talk "If I have to stand next to her every time she's struck with stage fright, I might have to get a cyborg hand replacement."
